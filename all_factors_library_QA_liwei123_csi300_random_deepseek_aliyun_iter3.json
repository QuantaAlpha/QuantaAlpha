The factors measure volume acceleration, price-volume divergence, and intraday volatility persistence, but these are general market microstructure signals rather than earnings-specific behavioral biases. The empty result prevents any meaningful performance comparison with SOTA.",

The hypothesis specifically mentions 'post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD) amplified when earnings surprises interact with analyst forecast dispersion and institutional ownership changes', yet none of the factors incorporate earnings surprise data, analyst forecasts, institutional ownership, options positioning, or short interest dynamics.

It connects earnings surprises (which can be approximated using price reactions around earnings dates) with volume patterns and price-volume dynamics. The hypothesis is testable with the available price and volume data by: 1) Identifying earnings announcement periods, 2) Measuring earnings surprise through price reactions, 3) Calculating volume acceleration around these events, 4) Assessing price-volume divergence. This approach creates a more focused and implementable test of behavioral biases while staying within data constraints. The factor construction should be simpler, with clear earnings event anchoring and straightforward calculations to avoid overfitting."

This approach reduces complexity while maintaining the core idea of momentum persistence in favorable conditions.

The lack of results prevents any meaningful comparison with SOTA or evaluation of the regime-aware mean reversion concept.",

However, the theoretical framework appears overly complex with multiple interacting components: fundamental deterioration detection, volatility regime classification, trend stability filtering, and liquidity constraints.

The core insight from the original hypothesis - that volatility regime transitions (short-term > medium-term volatility) might amplify mean reversion signals - can be tested independently. By removing the fundamental deterioration component (which requires accurate return calculations over multiple periods) and trend stability filtering (which adds correlation calculations), we reduce the implementation surface area and potential failure points. A simpler factor using only price returns and volatility ratios is more likely to execute successfully and provide a baseline for incremental improvements."

The factors seem overly complex with multiple nested operations (TS_MEAN of TS_STD, TS_ZSCORE of ratios, etc.), which may be causing calculation failures or producing excessive NaN values. The factors also mix different time horizons (3-day, 5-day, 10-day, 15-day, 20-day) without clear justification for these specific windows.",

The new hypothesis focuses on the core elements: (1) negative return momentum as a proxy for fundamental deterioration, (2) short-term volatility spikes relative to medium-term baseline, and (3) volume attention as a catalyst. By simplifying the mathematical expressions and reducing nested operations, we can create more robust factors that actually produce results. The key is to test whether this combination provides predictive power for mean-reversion, which requires functional implementations first. We should start with simpler, more transparent factor constructions to establish a baseline before adding complexity."
