        "observations": "The current experiment tested two factors (Retail_Overload_Reversal_10D and Cognitive_Stress_Indicator_7D) derived from the hypothesis about textual complexity and retail trading activity. The combined results show mixed performance compared to SOTA: while annualized return (0.064059 vs 0.052010) and IC (0.007583 vs 0.005798) improved, information ratio (0.930813 vs 0.972561) and max drawdown (-0.076290 vs -0.072585) deteriorated. The hypothesis appears partially supported but requires refinement in factor construction to achieve more consistent improvements across all metrics.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis receives partial support from the experimental results. The improved annualized return and IC suggest that the core idea - combining complexity proxies with retail activity indicators - has merit for predicting short-term reversals. However, the deterioration in information ratio and max drawdown indicates that the current factor implementations may not adequately manage risk or may be capturing noise alongside signal. The Cognitive_Stress_Indicator_7D factor (which showed better performance in preliminary analysis) aligns more closely with the cognitive overload mechanism by measuring divergence between price and volume momentum, while Retail_Overload_Reversal_10D's simpler ratio-based approach may be less effective.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "The Cognitive_Stress_Indicator_7D factor performed better than Retail_Overload_Reversal_10D in the experiment, suggesting that momentum divergence may be a more effective measure of cognitive stress than volume ratios. However, both factors could be improved by: 1) Using normalized volatility instead of raw price range to better capture complexity, 2) Incorporating mean reversion signals more directly, 3) Simplifying the mathematical expressions to reduce overfitting risk. The next iteration should focus on creating simpler, more interpretable factors that maintain the core divergence concept while using fewer parameters and operations."
