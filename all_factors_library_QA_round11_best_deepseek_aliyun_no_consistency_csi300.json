All three factors show weak performance across all metrics compared to the SOTA result. The IC values (0.0029 vs 0.0058 SOTA) indicate very low predictive power, suggesting the current factor constructions are not effectively capturing the hypothesized regime shifts. The annualized return (0.0144 vs 0.0520 SOTA) and information ratio (0.2459 vs 0.9726 SOTA) are significantly worse, while the max drawdown is also worse (-0.1066 vs -0.0726 SOTA). The factor complexity analysis reveals potential issues: Volume_Weighted_Volatility_Regime_Shift_5D has Symbol Length 75, ER 2, PC 1; Volatility_Volume_Resonance_Stability_5D has Symbol Length 85, ER 2, PC 1; Volume_Weighted_Volatility_Momentum_5D has Symbol Length 86, ER 2, PC 1.

All three factor implementations underperform significantly compared to SOTA across all metrics. The weak IC values (0.0029) suggest minimal correlation with future returns, indicating the factor constructions are not effectively capturing the hypothesized market dynamics. The volume-weighted volatility concept may be too simplistic or the 5-day window may not be optimal for identifying meaningful regime shifts. The poor performance across all metrics suggests either: 1) The theoretical framework needs refinement, 2) The mathematical implementation doesn't accurately capture the intended phenomenon, or 3) The specific combination of signals doesn't provide predictive power in the tested market context.",

The poor performance suggests simplification is needed. A momentum-based approach focusing on acceleration (second derivative) rather than level comparisons might better capture transitional phases. Using cross-sectional ranking instead of time-series z-score could provide cleaner signals. The new hypothesis proposes: 1) Simpler mathematical formulation to reduce overfitting risk, 2) Focus on acceleration rather than level comparisons, 3) Cross-sectional normalization instead of time-series operations, 4) Optimized time horizons based on empirical testing. This approach maintains the core idea of identifying abnormal price-volume dynamics but implements it more cleanly and directly."

The new hypothesis proposes: 1) Time-series normalization of both components to reduce cross-sectional noise, 2) Volatility adjustment (e.g., dividing KLEN by recent volatility) to identify 'abnormal' volatility, 3) Asymmetric treatment since positive price-volume correlation (institutional buying) may have different implications than negative correlation (institutional selling).

The core insight - that simultaneous high volatility and unstable volume indicates panic selling - should be testable with simpler formulations. A 3-day window may capture the immediate nature of panic selling better than 5-10 day windows.

The worse max drawdown suggests these efficiency states may not provide the hypothesized lower volatility. The complexity of the factors (multiple regressions, R-squared calculations, residual transformations) likely introduces noise and overfitting, masking the core efficiency signal. The hypothesis might be valid but needs simpler implementation to extract the pure efficiency signal without mathematical complexity.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors are over-engineered with multiple regression components, R-squared calculations, and residual transformations. This complexity creates high symbol length and likely overfitting, as evidenced by the modest IC values despite mathematical sophistication. A simpler approach using basic price change and volatility ratios could capture the core efficiency concept (price movement per unit of noise) without the overfitting risk. The 5-day window aligns with the original hypothesis timeframe. By reducing complexity to 2-3 core features instead of 6+, we can create a more robust factor that generalizes better to test data. This addresses the critical complexity issue while maintaining the efficiency concept."

The weak IC (0.0034) suggests the factors are capturing noise rather than strong predictive signals.

        "observations": "The current experiment tested two factors from the cross-asset information flow hypothesis: RegimeUncertainty_Residual_Momentum_20D and InformationFlow_Dispersion_10D. Both factors showed promising results, with the combined portfolio outperforming the SOTA benchmark across all key metrics: higher information ratio (1.112 vs 0.973), higher annualized return (7.53% vs 5.20%), higher IC (0.0087 vs 0.0058), and comparable max drawdown (-8.15% vs -7.26%). This suggests that capturing residual momentum and information dispersion during uncertain regimes has predictive value. However, the factors show mixed performance individually - InformationFlow_Dispersion_10D performed better than RegimeUncertainty_Residual_Momentum_20D, indicating that measuring dispersion may be more effective than residual momentum in this context.",

The strong performance of InformationFlow_Dispersion_10D suggests that measuring how individual stock volatility relates to cross-sectional dispersion is an effective signal. However, we cannot fully verify the hypothesis since the lead-lag correlation factor (CrossAsset_LeadLag_Correlation_15D) was not implemented, and we didn't test actual cross-asset relationships (commodities, currencies, ETFs) - only cross-sectional stock market relationships. The hypothesis needs refinement: instead of focusing on 'cross-asset' in the broad sense, we should explore specific types of dispersion and residual signals within the equity market.",

The relatively good IC but poor portfolio metrics suggest potential overfitting - the factors may fit noise in the training data rather than capturing true market patterns. The new hypothesis prioritizes simplicity (<150 characters expression length) to improve generalization. Specifically: 1) Remove unnecessary transformations like RANK and ZSCORE initially, 2) Use shorter windows (3-5 days instead of 10), 3) Focus on the core gap-to-range ratio without volume or persistence components initially, 4) Test raw ratio vs simple moving average versions."

The max drawdowns are relatively high, particularly for PriceVolume_Correlation_AuctionConcentration_20D at -16.5%, suggesting risk management issues.

All three factors show positive IC, confirming the directional relationship exists. However, the effect size is small (IC ~0.005 vs SOTA 0.0058), and the performance metrics lag significantly behind SOTA. The MultiTimeframe factor performed best, suggesting that combining multiple timeframes (25-day correlation with 5-day volume mean) works better than single-timeframe approaches. The volatility conditioning appears too simplistic - using standard deviation of close prices or high-low ranges as inverse multipliers may not effectively capture regime-dependent behavior. The gap stability filters (using IF statements with hard thresholds) likely introduce noise rather than meaningful conditioning.",

        "reason": "The current factors suffer from three main issues: 1) Excessive complexity with nested functions, conditional statements, and multiple ranking operations (symbol lengths >250 characters), increasing overfitting risk. 2) Ineffective volatility conditioning - using price volatility as denominator doesn't properly capture correlation stability. 3) Redundant operations - the RANK() function applied to already normalized values adds noise. The proposed simplification addresses these by: using correlation volatility instead of price volatility for normalization (more directly relevant), removing all conditional IF statements (reducing free parameters), eliminating redundant RANK() operations, and reducing symbol length to ~120 characters. This maintains the core theoretical framework while drastically reducing complexity, which should improve out-of-sample robustness. The 20-day correlation window with 5-day volume mean proved effective in the MultiTimeframe factor, so we preserve that structure."

The hypothesis about 'more persistent alpha' receives mixed support - while returns are higher, the risk characteristics are less favorable.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current convergence factor shows promising alpha generation but poor risk management. The deterioration in information ratio and max drawdown indicates the simple multiplicative approach amplifies volatility. By normalizing the gap reversal component with recent volatility (e.g., using standard deviation of returns over the same period), we can maintain the directional signal while controlling for volatility spikes. This should preserve the improved IC and annualized return while enhancing the information ratio and reducing drawdowns. The formulation should be simpler than the current one to avoid overfitting concerns."

The 5-day window for momentum shows promise but could be optimized to 3-7 days. Volume should be normalized rather than using raw standard deviation. The key insight is that institutional order flow patterns manifest as consistent buying/selling pressure during momentum phases, which can be captured through price position within daily range combined with volume confirmation."

Given the complexity warnings in the instructions, these factors are probably overfitting despite their poor test performance. We need to return to simpler constructions: focus on core volume-price relationships, use consistent and theoretically justified window sizes, and avoid excessive feature combinations. A simpler approach might be: 'Volume persistence during price stability periods' measured as correlation(volume, lag(volume)) / price_range_std over a single consistent window."

        "observations": "The current experiment produced three factors based on the hypothesis combining sector-level momentum divergence with instrument-level microstructure confirmation. All three factors show similar but slightly inferior performance compared to the SOTA result across all key metrics. The IC (0.005438 vs 0.005798) and information ratio (0.820177 vs 0.972561) are lower, while annualized return is nearly identical (0.051801 vs 0.052010) and max drawdown is worse (-0.097274 vs -0.072585). This suggests the current implementations capture some signal but fail to outperform the existing best approach. The factors appear moderately complex, with expressions ranging from 100-200 characters, which may contribute to suboptimal generalization.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results provide weak support for the hypothesis. While the factors generate positive returns and information ratios, they do not demonstrate 'superior risk-adjusted returns compared to strategies using either characteristic alone' as hypothesized. The combination approach shows promise but requires refinement. The key insight is that simply combining these signals with basic mathematical operations (multiplication, division, z-scoring) may not optimally capture the interaction between sector momentum and microstructure confirmation. The volatility adjustment appears to help but may need more sophisticated implementation.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors are over-engineered with multiple operations (z-score, sign, rank, absolute values) that may introduce noise and overfitting. The new hypothesis focuses on simplification while preserving the core idea: 1) Use a single momentum window (20-40 days) rather than multiple windows, 2) Incorporate volume confirmation through correlation or volume-weighted price changes rather than complex ratios, 3) Apply volatility normalization but with simpler weighting, 4) Avoid cross-sectional transformations that may introduce lookahead bias. This approach should reduce complexity (targeting <150 characters) while maintaining the essential signal combination. Specific improvements: Use TS_CORR(close, volume, 20) directly as a multiplier for momentum rather than complex ratios; simplify volatility adjustment to TS_MEAN(return, 20)/TS_STD(return, 20); remove unnecessary sign and absolute value operations."

The improved annualized return and IC suggest that combining sector momentum divergence with liquidity gap signals weighted by volatility regime does capture predictive information about sector outperformance.

A simpler approach would focus on the core insight: institutional rotation creates divergence between stock and sector momentum during liquidity stress. We should use simpler normalization and avoid multiplicative combinations of unrelated signals. The poor max drawdown suggests the volatility filter isn't working as intended - volume-based liquidity measures might be more direct indicators of market-making stress."

For example, instead of TS_CORR(return, (high-low)/TS_STD(close,20),20), consider a simpler volatility skew measure like (close - TS_MEAN(close,5))/TS_STD(close,20). Instead of the complex analyst revision proxy with two moving averages and division by standard deviation, use a cleaner momentum divergence like TS_MEAN(return,5) - TS_MEAN(return,20). The put-call ratio proxy should be simplified to a direct volume anomaly measure like volume/TS_MEAN(volume,20) * (high-low)/close.

All three factors were implemented and tested together. The combined results show mixed performance compared to the SOTA benchmark. While the annualized return (0.038066 vs 0.052010) and information ratio (0.542491 vs 0.972561) are significantly lower than SOTA, the max drawdown is slightly worse (-0.081059 vs -0.072585) and the IC is slightly lower (0.005303 vs 0.005798). The factors appear to capture some signal (positive IC) but not enough to outperform the existing benchmark. The complexity of the factors needs attention - particularly Put_Call_Ratio_Volume_Proxy_10D with its SIGN function and nested operations, and Volatility_Skew_Price_Interaction_20D with RANK and TS_CORR operations.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results provide partial support for the hypothesis but suggest the current implementation is suboptimal. The positive IC values (0.005303) indicate that the factors do capture some systematic mispricing patterns related to cognitive biases, confirming the hypothesis has merit. However, the performance metrics being lower than SOTA suggests either: 1) The specific proxies chosen (volatility skew via price range, analyst revisions via return divergence, put-call ratio via volume-volatility correlation) may not be optimal representations of the underlying cognitive biases, or 2) The mathematical formulations need refinement to better capture the hypothesized effects. The hypothesis remains valid but requires better operationalization.",

        "reason": "The current factors show promise (positive IC) but underperform SOTA, likely due to over-complex formulations that introduce noise and overfitting. The new hypothesis focuses on simplification: 1) Replace complex interactions with cleaner signals (e.g., direct volatility skew measures rather than correlations with normalized range), 2) Reduce parameter counts and nested operations, 3) Use more intuitive proxies for the cognitive biases. For example, instead of TS_CORR(return, (high-low)/TS_STD(close,20),20), consider a simpler volatility skew measure like (close - TS_MEAN(close,5))/TS_STD(close,20). Instead of the complex analyst revision proxy with two moving averages and division by standard deviation, use a cleaner momentum divergence like TS_MEAN(return,5) - TS_MEAN(return,20). The put-call ratio proxy should be simplified to a direct volume anomaly measure like volume/TS_MEAN(volume,20) * (high-low)/close. This maintains the core idea of capturing cognitive biases but with fewer operations and parameters, reducing overfitting risk while potentially improving signal quality."

The new hypothesis focuses on a single, cleaner construction that directly measures the core concept: when retail attention (proxied by volume acceleration) diverges from price movement in a way that suggests overreaction. By simplifying to one well-constructed factor rather than three complex ones, we reduce noise, minimize overfitting, and create a more interpretable signal. The focus should be on volume acceleration relative to price movement during earnings-sensitive periods, with careful normalization to avoid spurious correlations."

The annualized return of 4.24% vs 5.20% shows weaker absolute performance, and the worse max drawdown (-9.83% vs -7.26%) indicates higher risk.

        "observations": "The current experiment tested two factors from the complex hypothesis framework: Microstructure_Fundamental_Divergence_20D and Sector_Liquidity_Rotation_40D. Both factors performed worse than the SOTA result across all key metrics. The information ratio (0.526 vs 0.973), annualized return (0.041 vs 0.052), and IC (0.0055 vs 0.0058) all show deterioration. The max drawdown is also worse (-0.116 vs -0.073). The Volatility_Regime_Convergence_30D factor was not implemented, leaving the full hypothesis untested. The implemented factors show concerning complexity with long expressions and multiple nested functions, suggesting potential overfitting despite poor out-of-sample performance.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The current results REFUTE the hypothesis that combining microstructure liquidity stress with institutional capital rotation through complex multi-component integration predicts stock outperformance. The implemented factors underperformed SOTA significantly. The hypothesis may be fundamentally flawed, or more likely, the implementation is overly complex and suffers from overfitting. The factors use multiple nested operations (RANK, TS_MEAN, TS_STD, TS_CORR) on derived features like (high-low)/(volume+1e-8), creating high-dimensional transformations that likely capture noise rather than signal. The 20D and 40D lookback periods may not be optimal for capturing the proposed phenomena.",

        "reason": "The current complex factors failed to outperform SOTA despite their sophisticated construction. This suggests that: 1) The hypothesis may be trying to capture too many phenomena simultaneously, diluting signal strength; 2) The mathematical complexity introduces estimation error and overfitting; 3) The core intuition about liquidity stress might be valid but needs simpler implementation. A simpler factor focusing on the basic relationship between price range, volume, and volatility could capture similar information without the overfitting risk. The new hypothesis prioritizes robustness over complexity, using fewer operations and parameters while maintaining economic intuition about liquidity conditions affecting returns."

While it achieves a higher annualized return (0.064567 vs 0.052010) and better IC (0.008672 vs 0.005798), it underperforms in risk-adjusted metrics: higher maximum drawdown (-0.117804 vs -0.072585) and lower information ratio (0.751891 vs 0.972561). This suggests the current implementation captures some alpha signal but with significantly higher risk exposure and poorer risk-adjusted returns. The divergence between improved raw returns and deteriorated risk metrics indicates potential overfitting or instability in the factor construction.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results provide partial support for the hypothesis. The improved IC and annualized return suggest that combining insider accumulation patterns, sector divergence, and volatility weighting does capture meaningful alpha signals. However, the significant deterioration in drawdown and information ratio indicates that the current implementation may not effectively manage risk during market uncertainty regimes as hypothesized. The volatility weighting mechanism in particular appears insufficient to mitigate downside risk, suggesting the multi-dimensional adaptation to market regimes needs refinement.",

        "reason": "The current implementation shows promise in signal generation (higher IC) but fails in risk management. The complexity of the factors, particularly the multiple transformations and cross-sectional operations, likely introduces noise and overfitting. The volatility weighting approach (VWM_10D) appears to amplify rather than mitigate risk. A simpler approach focusing on: 1) Insider-volume correlation with shorter lookback (10-15 days), 2) Pure sector momentum ranking without complex normalization, and 3) Binary volatility filtering (exclude stocks when market volatility exceeds threshold) would reduce complexity while maintaining the core hypothesis. This addresses the critical complexity issue while preserving the multi-dimensional insight."

While the IC (0.006020) slightly outperforms SOTA (0.005798), all three risk-adjusted return metrics (information ratio, annualized return, and max drawdown) are significantly worse than SOTA. The information ratio is particularly concerning at 0.415 vs 0.973, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The annualized return is only 58% of SOTA (0.0304 vs 0.0520), and the max drawdown is worse (-0.0861 vs -0.0726).

The 60-day window for insider clustering may be too long, missing shorter-term coordinated activity. The retail capitulation factor uses high-low range divided by volume standard deviation, which may not optimally capture retail distress. The ranking operations applied to all factors may destroy valuable magnitude information. We need simpler, more direct measures: 1) Replace volume clustering count with a simpler volume concentration ratio, 2) Simplify price-volume correlation calculation, 3) Use a more direct retail capitulation signal like volume-weighted price decline during high volatility periods. The core insight - that coordinated accumulation followed by institutional confirmation during retail distress creates alpha - remains valid but needs cleaner implementation."

        "observations": "The current experiment tested three factors derived from the hypothesis about structural mispricing through liquidity-fundamental divergence with institutional confirmation. All three factors were successfully implemented and tested. The combined results show that while the factors capture some predictive signal (IC = 0.004221), they significantly underperform the SOTA benchmark across all key metrics: annualized return (0.038373 vs 0.052010), information ratio (0.596225 vs 0.972561), and max drawdown (-0.113202 vs -0.072585). The IC is also lower than SOTA (0.004221 vs 0.005798). This suggests the current factor construction approach is not effectively capturing the hypothesized structural mispricing signals.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis that 'volatility-weighted divergence between short-term order flow liquidity and medium-term fundamental stability, validated through sector momentum and institutional participation signals, predicts future returns' is NOT supported by the current results. The constructed factors show weak predictive power and poor portfolio performance compared to SOTA. The key issues appear to be: 1) The mathematical formulations may be overly complex and potentially overfitting, 2) The combination of multiple signals (liquidity, volatility, momentum, correlation) may be diluting rather than strengthening the predictive signal, 3) The specific proxies used (volume-normalized price range for liquidity, return volatility for fundamental stability) may not be optimal representations of the theoretical concepts.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current approach failed because it attempted to combine too many complex signals into single factors, likely leading to overfitting and signal dilution. The new hypothesis simplifies the approach by focusing on two core components: 1) price efficiency vs trading activity divergence, and 2) momentum direction as a validation mechanism. This maintains the core idea of identifying structural mispricing but uses simpler, more interpretable components. The simplification addresses the complexity concerns while potentially capturing cleaner predictive signals. The focus on 'normalized divergence' rather than complex volatility-weighting may provide more stable signals. The use of 'volume persistence' rather than volume-normalized price range may better capture institutional activity patterns."

The positive IC indicates the factors have predictive power, confirming that information diffusion patterns contain signal. However, the performance gap relative to SOTA suggests either: 1) The specific mathematical implementations need refinement, 2) The asymmetry signals are weaker than other market inefficiencies captured by SOTA, or 3) The factors may be capturing noise rather than persistent market anomalies.

The core insight - slower absorption of negative information leads to predictable reversals - can be captured more simply. A factor using: 1) Price momentum after negative days, 2) Normalization by volatility, 3) Cross-sectional ranking. This reduces complexity while maintaining the theoretical framework. The poor max drawdown in current results suggests the factors may be overreacting to extreme events; a simpler formulation with robust normalization could improve risk-adjusted performance. The positive IC indicates the direction is promising but needs cleaner implementation."

The new hypothesis simplifies the framework to focus on the core interaction between price-volume correlation, sentiment shocks, and momentum patterns. By reducing complexity and using fewer raw features (close, volume, return), we can create a more robust factor that generalizes better. The poor test performance relative to SOTA (IC of 0.003969 vs 0.005798) suggests overfitting, which simpler factors should mitigate."

The much worse max drawdown (-0.103929 vs SOTA -0.072585) suggests inadequate risk management during adverse periods.

ICSS_10D uses multiple operations (DELTA, TS_MEAN, SIGN, TS_STD) with three different time windows, making it prone to noise. IAVR_20D combines volume ratios with price volatility normalization. Both factors should be simplified: 1) Focus on core volume spikes relative to short-term averages (5-10 days) rather than complex ratios, 2) Use simpler volatility adjustments (e.g., rolling standard deviation of returns rather than price), 3) Reduce parameter counts and expression lengths to below 150 characters. The missing sector momentum component should be tested separately before integration."

While the information ratio (1.083 vs 0.973), annualized return (0.076 vs 0.052), and IC (0.0084 vs 0.0058) all show improvement, the max drawdown has worsened significantly (-0.090 vs -0.073). This suggests the current factors may be capturing more signal but with increased volatility and risk. The IC improvement is particularly notable, indicating better predictive correlation. However, the factor formulations show concerning complexity patterns that likely contribute to the increased drawdown risk.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results provide partial support for the hypothesis but reveal implementation issues. The improved IC and annualized return suggest that combining network hierarchy and insider momentum concepts has merit, as predicted by the hypothesis. However, the significantly worse max drawdown indicates the current implementations may be capturing noise or creating unstable signals. The factor formulations show excessive complexity with long expressions (Network_Hierarchy_Volatility_Convergence_20D: ~120 chars, Network_Insider_Synergy_Composite_15D: ~150 chars), multiple nested functions, and conditional operations that likely lead to overfitting and unstable out-of-sample performance.

The factor formulations use multiple nested functions (DELAY, TS_STD, TS_ZSCORE, RANK, TS_CORR combinations), conditional SIGN operations, and complex ratios that create fragile signals. Simpler versions should: 1) Reduce expression length to under 100 characters, 2) Use fewer base features (focus on close, volume, returns), 3) Minimize free parameters and conditional operations, 4) Create more stable signals with smoother transitions. For example, replace SIGN(DELAY(TS_STD(...))) with simpler volatility trend measures, and simplify the composite factor to avoid division operations that can create extreme values."

        "observations": "The combined result shows that the current factors underperform the SOTA across all key metrics. While the hypothesis about event-driven inefficiencies has theoretical merit, the current implementations fail to capture exploitable alpha effectively. The most concerning aspect is the significant gap in information ratio (0.60 vs 0.97 SOTA), indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. The max drawdown is also worse (-0.106 vs -0.073 SOTA), suggesting the factors may amplify losses during adverse periods. The IC of 0.0046 is low, indicating weak predictive power for next-day returns. This suggests the factors are either poorly constructed or the hypothesis needs refinement in its implementation.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis that event-driven inefficiencies create exploitable dislocations over 3-10 days is partially supported but requires better implementation. The current factors show some predictive ability (positive IC) but insufficient to beat SOTA. The main issues appear to be: 1) Overly complex formulations that may be overfitting to noise rather than capturing true signals, 2) Insufficient focus on the specific 3-10 day correction window mentioned in the hypothesis, 3) Lack of direct event detection mechanisms - the current factors rely on price/volume patterns that could be caused by many factors beyond corporate events. The Event_Shock_Intensity_5D shows promise but needs refinement.",

        "reason": "The current factors suffer from excessive complexity (Event_Induced_Mispricing_Score_10D has multiple nested operations and cross-sectional ranking). Simpler factors with clear economic intuition are more likely to generalize. The core insight - that sudden events create temporary mispricing - should be captured through straightforward measures: 1) How large is the price move relative to normal volatility? 2) Is there unusual volume confirming the event? 3) Has the price deviated significantly from its recent trend? By simplifying to these core components and keeping each factor under 150 characters, we reduce overfitting risk while maintaining the hypothesis's economic rationale. The 3-10 day correction window suggests focusing on 5-day and 10-day horizons rather than mixing multiple timeframes."

Liquidity_Constrained_Momentum_10D's volatility-to-volume ratio may not effectively identify liquidity constraints that amplify trends.

Shorter lookback periods (5-10 days) may better capture recent institutional positioning changes. Alternative approaches could include: volume-weighted price momentum, abnormal volume detection relative to historical norms, or price impact measures that better proxy for institutional order flow.

        "observations": "The current experiment tests three factors derived from the institutional rebalancing hypothesis: ETF flow proxy, illiquidity measure, and ownership distance proxy. The combined results show performance significantly below the SOTA across all key metrics. The annualized return is only 37.6% of SOTA (0.0195 vs 0.0520), information ratio is 28.1% of SOTA (0.273 vs 0.973), and IC is slightly lower (0.0056 vs 0.0058). The max drawdown is worse (-0.0893 vs -0.0726). This suggests the current factor construction approach is ineffective at capturing the hypothesized alpha signals.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is NOT supported by the current results. While the theoretical framework of institutional rebalancing inefficiencies remains plausible, the specific factor implementations failed to generate meaningful predictive signals. The ETF flow proxy (5-day price-volume correlation sign) appears too simplistic to capture actual institutional flow patterns. The illiquidity measure (Amihud's 10-day) and ownership distance proxy (15-day log(price/volume) volatility) may not be optimally parameterized or may be measuring different phenomena than intended. The weak IC (0.0056) indicates minimal correlation with future returns, suggesting these factors are not capturing the temporary mispricing patterns hypothesized.",

The new hypothesis focuses on the INTERACTION between flow and liquidity rather than treating them as separate signals. It also shifts from static illiquidity measures to CHANGES in liquidity conditions, which may better capture deteriorating market conditions that amplify institutional impact. The reversal window is shortened to 3-7 days based on typical institutional settlement cycles. The new approach should test: 1) Flow-liquidity interaction factors, 2) Dynamic rather than static liquidity measures, 3) Shorter lookback periods (3-10 days) to capture recent institutional activity, 4) Volume-based rather than correlation-based flow proxies."

The improved annualized return suggests that capturing the gap between fundamental quality and market perception has alpha potential. However, the deterioration in information ratio and drawdown indicates that the current factor construction may not be efficiently capturing the mispricing resolution process.

The new hypothesis focuses on the intersection of two clear conditions rather than their mathematical combination. This should reduce overfitting risk while maintaining the core theoretical insight.

        "observations": "The current multi-factor combination shows mixed results compared to SOTA. While it achieves a higher annualized return (0.053532 vs 0.052010) and better IC (0.009085 vs 0.005798), it underperforms significantly in risk-adjusted metrics: higher maximum drawdown (-0.149128 vs -0.072585) and lower information ratio (0.695030 vs 0.972561). This suggests the current factors capture some predictive signal but introduce substantial volatility and tail risk. The hypothesis about multi-timeframe convergence shows partial validation - the factors do generate alpha, but the risk management aspect needs improvement.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis receives partial support. The combination demonstrates alpha-generating capability (higher annualized return and IC), confirming that multi-timeframe signals can be effective. However, the deterioration in risk metrics indicates either: 1) The factors amplify downside risk during stress periods rather than providing protection, 2) The convergence signals create concentrated exposures that lead to larger drawdowns, or 3) The volatility normalization in OGRVN_{10D} may not adequately control risk. The medium-term price-volume reversal factor (MTPVR_{35D}) appears particularly problematic, as negative correlation between returns and volume changes might amplify selling pressure during downturns.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current results suggest that complexity (three factors with different timeframes) increases model risk without proportional reward. The poor risk metrics indicate overfitting to specific market regimes. Simplifying to two core factors (volatility quality filter and overnight gap reversal) while maintaining volatility normalization could preserve alpha generation while reducing drawdowns. The medium-term factor (35-day correlation) likely introduces noise and amplifies losses during market stress. Future iterations should prioritize robustness over signal complexity, focusing on factors with clearer economic intuition and better risk properties."

However, the max drawdown worsened significantly (-0.124245 vs -0.072585), indicating poor downside protection. The IC improved slightly (0.009033 vs 0.005798), but remains very low, suggesting weak predictive power.

The improved annualized return and information ratio suggest that combining financial quality with network-insider dynamics can enhance alpha generation. However, the worsened max drawdown contradicts the hypothesis's claim about 'downside protection,' indicating the current implementation fails to provide resilience during market stress.

The hypothesis has merit, but the implementation needs radical simplification. Next iteration should focus on: 1) Reducing Financial_Quality_Stability factor to <150 characters using only 2-3 core features; 2) Simplifying Network_Insider_Momentum to basic correlation between price and volume changes; 3) Creating a simple weighted average composite rather than complex regime-adaptive formula.
