However, the factor exhibits significantly worse drawdown (-0.108043 vs -0.072585) and slightly lower information ratio (0.963355 vs 0.972561). The dramatic IC improvement suggests the hypothesis captures genuine signal, but the increased drawdown indicates higher tail risk exposure, which ironically contradicts the factor's goal of managing tail risk. The combination of three distinct components (volume-weighted skewness, sector-relative volatility, momentum divergence) appears to create a powerful but volatile signal.",

However, the hypothesis's claim about 'superior risk-adjusted returns' is contradicted by the worse max drawdown and slightly lower information ratio. The factor appears to identify high-conviction signals but at the cost of increased portfolio volatility and tail risk. The three components may be contributing unevenly: (1) Volume-weighted skewness (10D) likely drives the strong IC through microstructure insights, (2) Sector-relative volatility may add noise or regime-specific signals that increase drawdown, (3) Momentum divergence (240-20D) could be introducing timing lags.

Key refinements: (1) EXTEND skewness window from 10D to 20D: 10 days may be too noisy for reliable tail risk measurement; 20 days balances responsiveness with stability and aligns with the sector volatility window. (2) SHORTEN long momentum from 240D to 120D: 240 days (nearly a year) may capture stale trends; 120 days maintains medium-term trend capture while improving responsiveness to regime changes. (3) REDUCE sector volatility from 20D to 10D: This creates better temporal alignment with the short-term momentum component and captures more recent microstructure transitions. (4) MAINTAIN the 20D short momentum: This serves as the recent trend baseline. (5) CONSIDER simpler combination: Instead of complex multi-component interaction, test sequential filtering or weighted averaging to reduce overfitting risk. The goal is to preserve the strong IC signal while dramatically improving drawdown through better temporal alignment and reduced complexity."

However, the factor exhibits significantly worse drawdown (-0.108043 vs -0.072585) and slightly lower information ratio (0.963355 vs 0.972561). The dramatic IC improvement suggests the hypothesis captures genuine signal, but the increased drawdown indicates higher tail risk exposure, which ironically contradicts the factor's goal of managing tail risk. The combination of three distinct components (volume-weighted skewness, sector-relative volatility, momentum divergence) appears to create a powerful but volatile signal.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is PARTIALLY SUPPORTED with critical caveats. The factor successfully captures informed trading signals as evidenced by the exceptional IC improvement (3.4x), validating that volume-weighted return distribution asymmetries, sector-relative volatility deviations, and momentum divergence contain predictive information. However, the hypothesis's claim about 'superior risk-adjusted returns' is contradicted by the worse max drawdown and slightly lower information ratio. The factor appears to identify high-conviction signals but at the cost of increased portfolio volatility and tail risk. The three components may be contributing unevenly: (1) Volume-weighted skewness (10D) likely drives the strong IC through microstructure insights, (2) Sector-relative volatility may add noise or regime-specific signals that increase drawdown, (3) Momentum divergence (240-20D) could be introducing timing lags. The 10-day window for skewness may be too short for stable tail risk measurement, while the 240-day momentum window may be capturing stale information in fast-moving markets.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "The current factor's exceptional IC demonstrates the core hypothesis has merit, but the poor risk-adjusted metrics suggest over-complexity or misaligned time horizons. Key refinements: (1) EXTEND skewness window from 10D to 20D: 10 days may be too noisy for reliable tail risk measurement; 20 days balances responsiveness with stability and aligns with the sector volatility window. (2) SHORTEN long momentum from 240D to 120D: 240 days (nearly a year) may capture stale trends; 120 days maintains medium-term trend capture while improving responsiveness to regime changes. (3) REDUCE sector volatility from 20D to 10D: This creates better temporal alignment with the short-term momentum component and captures more recent microstructure transitions. (4) MAINTAIN the 20D short momentum: This serves as the recent trend baseline. (5) CONSIDER simpler combination: Instead of complex multi-component interaction, test sequential filtering or weighted averaging to reduce overfitting risk. The goal is to preserve the strong IC signal while dramatically improving drawdown through better temporal alignment and reduced complexity."

(2) Address the increased max drawdown by incorporating volatility-based weighting (60-day volatility quintiles) instead of market cap quintiles, which should provide better risk adjustment. (3) Simplify the liquidity measure from 'Amihud illiquidity-adjusted' to 'volume-weighted price efficiency' to avoid potential complexity issues while maintaining the core concept of liquidity-conditional pricing inefficiencies. (4) The new factor should measure how much actual price deviates from its volume-weighted path over 20 days, normalized by typical deviations, which captures price discovery inefficiencies in a simpler, more interpretable way.

The substantial improvements in IC (+180%) and annualized return (+55%) validate the core theoretical framework.

        "reason": "While the current hypothesis performs well, three refinement opportunities exist: (1) **Regime Detection Enhancement**: The fixed median threshold for volatility regime may be too rigid - using adaptive percentile-based thresholds (e.g., 20th/80th) could better identify true regime shifts and reduce false signals during transitional periods. (2) **Momentum Window Optimization**: The 240-day lookback may be too long, causing delayed signals - testing 120-day vs 20-day divergence could capture trends more responsively while maintaining the reversal concept. (3) **Drawdown Mitigation**: The 40% increase in max drawdown is concerning - adding a conditional dampening mechanism (reducing position sizing when volatility regime exceeds 80th percentile) could preserve upside capture while limiting downside. (4) **Volume Quality Enhancement**: Replacing simple volume with VWAP deviation could better identify institutional momentum versus retail noise. These refinements maintain the core theoretical framework while addressing the drawdown weakness and potentially improving signal quality through more adaptive regime detection."

The new hypothesis maintains the three successful core components (momentum divergence, liquidity-adjusted volatility, price-volume patterns) while adding targeted enhancements: (1) Dual-threshold volatility regime detection provides more granular market state identification, allowing the factor to adapt more precisely to changing conditions. (2) Explicit drawdown protection through position scaling directly addresses the max drawdown concern without compromising the signal generation logic. (3) Simplifying price-volume coordination from 15-day correlation to 10-day volume surge patterns reduces computational complexity and potential overfitting while maintaining the essence of institutional participation detection. (4) Asymmetric signal strength based on volatility regimes allows the factor to be more aggressive in favorable conditions and more defensive in risky periods, which should improve risk-adjusted returns. This approach preserves the validated momentum divergence and liquidity efficiency signals while adding defensive mechanisms to control downside risk, targeting a better balance between return generation and risk management."

(2) **Adaptive momentum weighting**: The current momentum divergence uses simple sums (TS_SUM) which treats all days equally. Exponentially weighted momentum would give more weight to recent information, potentially improving timing at regime transitions. (3) **Volume-price efficiency refinement**: Current volume efficiency (volume/range) may be noisy when range is very small. Using volume per absolute price change (volume/|close-open|) could provide a more stable measure of genuine trading interest.

        "observations": "The current experiment tests three technical proxy factors attempting to capture fundamental-technical divergence without direct fundamental data. Results show mixed performance: IC improved significantly (0.013298 vs 0.005798 SOTA), indicating better predictive correlation, but portfolio metrics deteriorated with lower annualized return (0.048339 vs 0.052010), worse information ratio (0.634574 vs 0.972561), and larger max drawdown (-0.104899 vs -0.072585). The IC improvement suggests the factors capture some predictive signal, but the portfolio implementation suffers from higher volatility and drawdown, indicating the signals may be noisy or require better risk management. All three factors are purely technical constructs that attempt to proxy fundamental dynamics (accruals, analyst expectations) through price-volume patterns, which may explain the disconnect between IC and portfolio performance.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis posits that fundamental-technical divergence can predict alpha through mean-reversion or continuation patterns. However, the current implementation uses only technical proxies without actual fundamental data (no earnings quality metrics, accruals ratios, cash flow data, or analyst estimates). The three factors implemented are: (1) Momentum_Reversal_Divergence_12M_1M - a pure momentum divergence measure, (2) Volume_Price_Efficiency_Ratio_60D - a volume-weighted price efficiency metric attempting to proxy beta-adjusted returns, and (3) Price_Volatility_Momentum_Divergence_20D - a price-volatility divergence attempting to proxy analyst dispersion. While IC improved, suggesting these technical patterns have some predictive power, the deterioration in portfolio metrics (lower return, worse IR, larger drawdown) indicates that: (a) technical proxies cannot adequately substitute for actual fundamental data, (b) the divergence signals may be capturing noise rather than true fundamental-technical disconnects, or (c) the factors lack the sophistication to distinguish between mean-reversion and continuation regimes as hypothesized. The hypothesis requires actual fundamental data integration to be properly tested. The current purely technical approach shows promise in correlation but fails in risk-adjusted portfolio construction.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "Given the lack of fundamental data access and the mixed results from complex technical proxies, the new hypothesis pivots to a cleaner, more focused momentum quality framework. Rationale: (1) The improved IC (0.013298) demonstrates that technical patterns can capture predictive signals, but the poor portfolio metrics suggest overcomplexity or noise. (2) Rather than attempting to proxy fundamental metrics (accruals, analyst estimates) through convoluted technical constructs, we should focus on what technical data does well: identifying momentum quality and persistence. (3) The new approach simplifies to three core components: momentum consistency (correlation between different timeframes to identify stable trends), volume confirmation (to separate real moves from noise), and cross-sectional strength (to identify relative winners). (4) By reducing complexity and focusing on proven momentum factors with quality filters, we can potentially achieve better risk-adjusted returns while maintaining or improving IC. (5) The 6-month/1-month correlation replaces the complex 12-1 month divergence, the 20-day volume-weighted efficiency simplifies the 60-day ratio, and sector-relative 3-month momentum provides cleaner cross-sectional ranking than volatility-momentum divergence. This approach acknowledges data limitations while building on the IC improvement observed in the current experiment."

The IC improvement suggests the factors capture some predictive signal, but the portfolio implementation suffers from higher volatility and drawdown, indicating the signals may be noisy or require better risk management.

However, the current implementation uses only technical proxies without actual fundamental data (no earnings quality metrics, accruals ratios, cash flow data, or analyst estimates). The three factors implemented are: (1) Momentum_Reversal_Divergence_12M_1M - a pure momentum divergence measure, (2) Volume_Price_Efficiency_Ratio_60D - a volume-weighted price efficiency metric attempting to proxy beta-adjusted returns, and (3) Price_Volatility_Momentum_Divergence_20D - a price-volatility divergence attempting to proxy analyst dispersion. While IC improved, suggesting these technical patterns have some predictive power, the deterioration in portfolio metrics (lower return, worse IR, larger drawdown) indicates that: (a) technical proxies cannot adequately substitute for actual fundamental data, (b) the divergence signals may be capturing noise rather than true fundamental-technical disconnects, or (c) the factors lack the sophistication to distinguish between mean-reversion and continuation regimes as hypothesized.

Rationale: (1) The improved IC (0.013298) demonstrates that technical patterns can capture predictive signals, but the poor portfolio metrics suggest overcomplexity or noise. (2) Rather than attempting to proxy fundamental metrics (accruals, analyst estimates) through convoluted technical constructs, we should focus on what technical data does well: identifying momentum quality and persistence. (3) The new approach simplifies to three core components: momentum consistency (correlation between different timeframes to identify stable trends), volume confirmation (to separate real moves from noise), and cross-sectional strength (to identify relative winners). (4) By reducing complexity and focusing on proven momentum factors with quality filters, we can potentially achieve better risk-adjusted returns while maintaining or improving IC. (5) The 6-month/1-month correlation replaces the complex 12-1 month divergence, the 20-day volume-weighted efficiency simplifies the 60-day ratio, and sector-relative 3-month momentum provides cleaner cross-sectional ranking than volatility-momentum divergence.

        "observations": "The combined factor demonstrates strong performance across most metrics. The annualized return (0.075795 vs 0.052010) shows a 45.8% improvement over SOTA, and the Information Ratio (1.005646 vs 0.972561) indicates better risk-adjusted returns. The IC metric (0.016604 vs 0.005798) shows nearly 3x improvement in predictive power. However, the max drawdown (-0.120828 vs -0.072585) deteriorated by 66.5%, indicating higher tail risk. All three component factors were successfully implemented and tested together.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is PARTIALLY SUPPORTED with important caveats. The combination of sector-relative spread volatility, asymmetric volume-price discovery, and momentum divergence does generate superior returns (75.8 bps annualized vs 52.0 bps SOTA). The IC improvement suggests these signals capture genuine predictive information about short-term returns. However, the significantly worse max drawdown indicates the strategy experiences more severe losses during adverse market conditions, suggesting the factors may be capturing risk premia rather than pure alpha. The hypothesis's focus on 'liquidity quality exceeding sector median' as an amplification mechanism was not explicitly tested in the current implementation - the factors were combined additively without conditional logic based on dollar volume thresholds. This represents a key untested component of the original hypothesis.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current approach shows strong return generation but poor drawdown control, suggesting several refinements: (1) SIMPLIFICATION: Replace complex asymmetric volume-price discovery with simpler volume-momentum correlation to reduce overfitting risk and improve interpretability. (2) RISK MANAGEMENT: The 66.5% worse drawdown is unacceptable for practical implementation - add explicit volatility normalization to each component to control tail risk. (3) LIQUIDITY FILTER: Implement the originally hypothesized liquidity quality filter as a multiplicative gate rather than additive component, which should reduce exposure during illiquid periods when drawdowns are most severe. (4) PARAMETER OPTIMIZATION: Extend spread volatility window from 5 to 10 days for more stable signal, and adjust momentum windows (240/20 to 60/20) to reduce lookback period and improve signal freshness. (5) SECTOR ADJUSTMENT: Replace cross-sectional RANK/ZSCORE with explicit sector z-scoring to better capture sector-relative effects as originally intended. These changes maintain the theoretical framework while addressing the drawdown issue and simplifying factor construction for better generalization."

The adaptive approach maintains the strong IC and return performance while building in more defensive characteristics. By rebalancing toward quality (40% vs 30%) and reducing momentum exposure (30% vs 40%), the factor should achieve better risk-adjusted returns with lower drawdowns.

The max drawdown slightly worsened from -7.26% to -8.03% (+10.6%), which is acceptable given the substantial gains in return metrics. All three factors were successfully implemented and tested, providing comprehensive validation of the hypothesis framework.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is STRONGLY SUPPORTED by empirical results. The multi-component approach successfully captures microstructure inefficiencies through delayed sector response patterns, with the lead-lag correlation mechanism proving particularly effective (evidenced by the dramatic IC improvement). The momentum-reversal divergence (240-day vs 20-day) combined with volume efficiency filtering demonstrates robust signal extraction. The volatility regime transition weighting effectively identifies stable periods for momentum persistence. However, the slightly increased drawdown suggests the factors may benefit from additional risk controls or position sizing refinements. The hypothesis framework is sound and warrants further exploration through methodological refinement rather than directional changes.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "The current hypothesis demonstrates strong empirical support, but can be optimized through strategic simplification: (1) REDUCE LOOKBACK COMPLEXITY: The 240-day momentum window may introduce excessive historical dependency - testing 120-day could maintain trend capture while improving adaptability. Similarly, reducing the short-term window from 20 to 10 days may sharpen reversal detection. (2) SIMPLIFY VOLUME EFFICIENCY: The current 20-day volume efficiency calculation can be shortened to 10 days to reduce lag and improve responsiveness to recent regime changes. (3) STREAMLINE VOLATILITY REGIME: Instead of the complex 20-day vs 40-day ratio, use a simpler rolling 30-day volatility normalization to reduce parameter count while maintaining regime awareness. (4) MAINTAIN CORE MECHANISMS: Preserve the proven lead-lag correlation structure and volume-to-range efficiency concept, as these drive the strong IC performance. (5) RISK MANAGEMENT: The simplified approach should naturally reduce drawdown through faster adaptation to changing market conditions. This refinement maintains the theoretical foundation while reducing overfitting risk through fewer parameters and shorter lookback periods, potentially improving out-of-sample generalization."

The new hypothesis addresses this by: (1) Further reducing momentum weight in turbulent regimes from 0.3 to 0.2 to minimize exposure to potentially unstable price trends, (2) Introducing volatility-normalized momentum in turbulent regimes to reward risk-adjusted returns rather than absolute returns, and (3) Amplifying the return consistency component (1.0 → 1.5 weight) in turbulent regimes to prioritize stable, high-quality stocks. This refinement maintains the strong predictive power demonstrated in quiet and transition regimes while adding a more defensive posture during market stress. The approach stays within the same theoretical framework of regime-adaptive quality-momentum but fine-tunes the regime-specific behavior to balance return generation with risk control. The simplicity of the adjustment (modifying weights and adding volatility normalization only in turbulent regimes) minimizes the risk of overfitting while directly addressing the observed drawdown weakness."

Consolidating to two aligned windows (15D, 40D) reduces parameter count and improves interpretability. (2) CORE MECHANISM FOCUS: The liquidity efficiency differential and volatility regime transition appear to be the primary alpha drivers based on the strong IC improvement. The range compression signal (RCS) may be redundant or add noise. (3) UNIFIED METRIC: Using the same base metric (price-range-to-volume ratio) for both components creates a more coherent factor that measures regime shifts in a single liquidity-volatility characteristic rather than combining three separate signals. (4) PARAMETER ALIGNMENT: The 15D/40D window pair maintains the short-to-medium term relationship (ratio ~2.67) similar to the original 5D/20D (ratio 4.0) and 20D/60D (ratio 3.0) combinations, but with a single consistent timeframe.

The factor construction methodology—using normalized differentials, percentile rank transitions, and cross-sectional standardization—proves effective for this theoretical framework.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "While the current factor performs excellently, the hypothesis refinement focuses on simplification and robustness: (1) COMPLEXITY REDUCTION: The current factor uses four different time windows (5D, 8D, 20D, 60D) and three distinct components, which may lead to overfitting despite good current performance. Consolidating to two aligned windows (15D, 40D) reduces parameter count and improves interpretability. (2) CORE MECHANISM FOCUS: The liquidity efficiency differential and volatility regime transition appear to be the primary alpha drivers based on the strong IC improvement. The range compression signal (RCS) may be redundant or add noise. (3) UNIFIED METRIC: Using the same base metric (price-range-to-volume ratio) for both components creates a more coherent factor that measures regime shifts in a single liquidity-volatility characteristic rather than combining three separate signals. (4) PARAMETER ALIGNMENT: The 15D/40D window pair maintains the short-to-medium term relationship (ratio ~2.67) similar to the original 5D/20D (ratio 4.0) and 20D/60D (ratio 3.0) combinations, but with a single consistent timeframe. (5) ROBUSTNESS: Simpler factors with fewer parameters typically generalize better to out-of-sample data and different market regimes. The current factor's slight max drawdown deterioration suggests potential overfitting risk that simplification could address."
