The dramatic IC improvement suggests the hypothesis captures genuine signal, but the increased drawdown indicates higher tail risk exposure, which ironically contradicts the factor's goal of managing tail risk. The combination of three distinct components (volume-weighted skewness, sector-relative volatility, momentum divergence) appears to create a powerful but volatile signal.",

However, the hypothesis's claim about 'superior risk-adjusted returns' is contradicted by the worse max drawdown and slightly lower information ratio. The factor appears to identify high-conviction signals but at the cost of increased portfolio volatility and tail risk. The three components may be contributing unevenly: (1) Volume-weighted skewness (10D) likely drives the strong IC through microstructure insights, (2) Sector-relative volatility may add noise or regime-specific signals that increase drawdown, (3) Momentum divergence (240-20D) could be introducing timing lags.

Key refinements: (1) EXTEND skewness window from 10D to 20D: 10 days may be too noisy for reliable tail risk measurement; 20 days balances responsiveness with stability and aligns with the sector volatility window. (2) SHORTEN long momentum from 240D to 120D: 240 days (nearly a year) may capture stale trends; 120 days maintains medium-term trend capture while improving responsiveness to regime changes. (3) REDUCE sector volatility from 20D to 10D: This creates better temporal alignment with the short-term momentum component and captures more recent microstructure transitions. (4) MAINTAIN the 20D short momentum: This serves as the recent trend baseline. (5) CONSIDER simpler combination: Instead of complex multi-component interaction, test sequential filtering or weighted averaging to reduce overfitting risk. The goal is to preserve the strong IC signal while dramatically improving drawdown through better temporal alignment and reduced complexity."

However, the factor exhibits significantly worse drawdown (-0.108043 vs -0.072585) and slightly lower information ratio (0.963355 vs 0.972561). The dramatic IC improvement suggests the hypothesis captures genuine signal, but the increased drawdown indicates higher tail risk exposure, which ironically contradicts the factor's goal of managing tail risk. The combination of three distinct components (volume-weighted skewness, sector-relative volatility, momentum divergence) appears to create a powerful but volatile signal.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is PARTIALLY SUPPORTED with critical caveats. The factor successfully captures informed trading signals as evidenced by the exceptional IC improvement (3.4x), validating that volume-weighted return distribution asymmetries, sector-relative volatility deviations, and momentum divergence contain predictive information. However, the hypothesis's claim about 'superior risk-adjusted returns' is contradicted by the worse max drawdown and slightly lower information ratio. The factor appears to identify high-conviction signals but at the cost of increased portfolio volatility and tail risk. The three components may be contributing unevenly: (1) Volume-weighted skewness (10D) likely drives the strong IC through microstructure insights, (2) Sector-relative volatility may add noise or regime-specific signals that increase drawdown, (3) Momentum divergence (240-20D) could be introducing timing lags. The 10-day window for skewness may be too short for stable tail risk measurement, while the 240-day momentum window may be capturing stale information in fast-moving markets.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "The current factor's exceptional IC demonstrates the core hypothesis has merit, but the poor risk-adjusted metrics suggest over-complexity or misaligned time horizons. Key refinements: (1) EXTEND skewness window from 10D to 20D: 10 days may be too noisy for reliable tail risk measurement; 20 days balances responsiveness with stability and aligns with the sector volatility window. (2) SHORTEN long momentum from 240D to 120D: 240 days (nearly a year) may capture stale trends; 120 days maintains medium-term trend capture while improving responsiveness to regime changes. (3) REDUCE sector volatility from 20D to 10D: This creates better temporal alignment with the short-term momentum component and captures more recent microstructure transitions. (4) MAINTAIN the 20D short momentum: This serves as the recent trend baseline. (5) CONSIDER simpler combination: Instead of complex multi-component interaction, test sequential filtering or weighted averaging to reduce overfitting risk. The goal is to preserve the strong IC signal while dramatically improving drawdown through better temporal alignment and reduced complexity."

(2) Address the increased max drawdown by incorporating volatility-based weighting (60-day volatility quintiles) instead of market cap quintiles, which should provide better risk adjustment. (3) Simplify the liquidity measure from 'Amihud illiquidity-adjusted' to 'volume-weighted price efficiency' to avoid potential complexity issues while maintaining the core concept of liquidity-conditional pricing inefficiencies. (4) The new factor should measure how much actual price deviates from its volume-weighted path over 20 days, normalized by typical deviations, which captures price discovery inefficiencies in a simpler, more interpretable way.

The substantial improvements in IC (+180%) and annualized return (+55%) validate the core theoretical framework.

        "reason": "While the current hypothesis performs well, three refinement opportunities exist: (1) **Regime Detection Enhancement**: The fixed median threshold for volatility regime may be too rigid - using adaptive percentile-based thresholds (e.g., 20th/80th) could better identify true regime shifts and reduce false signals during transitional periods. (2) **Momentum Window Optimization**: The 240-day lookback may be too long, causing delayed signals - testing 120-day vs 20-day divergence could capture trends more responsively while maintaining the reversal concept. (3) **Drawdown Mitigation**: The 40% increase in max drawdown is concerning - adding a conditional dampening mechanism (reducing position sizing when volatility regime exceeds 80th percentile) could preserve upside capture while limiting downside. (4) **Volume Quality Enhancement**: Replacing simple volume with VWAP deviation could better identify institutional momentum versus retail noise. These refinements maintain the core theoretical framework while addressing the drawdown weakness and potentially improving signal quality through more adaptive regime detection."

The new hypothesis maintains the three successful core components (momentum divergence, liquidity-adjusted volatility, price-volume patterns) while adding targeted enhancements: (1) Dual-threshold volatility regime detection provides more granular market state identification, allowing the factor to adapt more precisely to changing conditions. (2) Explicit drawdown protection through position scaling directly addresses the max drawdown concern without compromising the signal generation logic. (3) Simplifying price-volume coordination from 15-day correlation to 10-day volume surge patterns reduces computational complexity and potential overfitting while maintaining the essence of institutional participation detection. (4) Asymmetric signal strength based on volatility regimes allows the factor to be more aggressive in favorable conditions and more defensive in risky periods, which should improve risk-adjusted returns. This approach preserves the validated momentum divergence and liquidity efficiency signals while adding defensive mechanisms to control downside risk, targeting a better balance between return generation and risk management."

(2) **Adaptive momentum weighting**: The current momentum divergence uses simple sums (TS_SUM) which treats all days equally. Exponentially weighted momentum would give more weight to recent information, potentially improving timing at regime transitions. (3) **Volume-price efficiency refinement**: Current volume efficiency (volume/range) may be noisy when range is very small. Using volume per absolute price change (volume/|close-open|) could provide a more stable measure of genuine trading interest.

        "observations": "The current experiment tests three technical proxy factors attempting to capture fundamental-technical divergence without direct fundamental data. Results show mixed performance: IC improved significantly (0.013298 vs 0.005798 SOTA), indicating better predictive correlation, but portfolio metrics deteriorated with lower annualized return (0.048339 vs 0.052010), worse information ratio (0.634574 vs 0.972561), and larger max drawdown (-0.104899 vs -0.072585). The IC improvement suggests the factors capture some predictive signal, but the portfolio implementation suffers from higher volatility and drawdown, indicating the signals may be noisy or require better risk management. All three factors are purely technical constructs that attempt to proxy fundamental dynamics (accruals, analyst expectations) through price-volume patterns, which may explain the disconnect between IC and portfolio performance.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis posits that fundamental-technical divergence can predict alpha through mean-reversion or continuation patterns. However, the current implementation uses only technical proxies without actual fundamental data (no earnings quality metrics, accruals ratios, cash flow data, or analyst estimates). The three factors implemented are: (1) Momentum_Reversal_Divergence_12M_1M - a pure momentum divergence measure, (2) Volume_Price_Efficiency_Ratio_60D - a volume-weighted price efficiency metric attempting to proxy beta-adjusted returns, and (3) Price_Volatility_Momentum_Divergence_20D - a price-volatility divergence attempting to proxy analyst dispersion. While IC improved, suggesting these technical patterns have some predictive power, the deterioration in portfolio metrics (lower return, worse IR, larger drawdown) indicates that: (a) technical proxies cannot adequately substitute for actual fundamental data, (b) the divergence signals may be capturing noise rather than true fundamental-technical disconnects, or (c) the factors lack the sophistication to distinguish between mean-reversion and continuation regimes as hypothesized. The hypothesis requires actual fundamental data integration to be properly tested. The current purely technical approach shows promise in correlation but fails in risk-adjusted portfolio construction.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "Given the lack of fundamental data access and the mixed results from complex technical proxies, the new hypothesis pivots to a cleaner, more focused momentum quality framework. Rationale: (1) The improved IC (0.013298) demonstrates that technical patterns can capture predictive signals, but the poor portfolio metrics suggest overcomplexity or noise. (2) Rather than attempting to proxy fundamental metrics (accruals, analyst estimates) through convoluted technical constructs, we should focus on what technical data does well: identifying momentum quality and persistence. (3) The new approach simplifies to three core components: momentum consistency (correlation between different timeframes to identify stable trends), volume confirmation (to separate real moves from noise), and cross-sectional strength (to identify relative winners). (4) By reducing complexity and focusing on proven momentum factors with quality filters, we can potentially achieve better risk-adjusted returns while maintaining or improving IC. (5) The 6-month/1-month correlation replaces the complex 12-1 month divergence, the 20-day volume-weighted efficiency simplifies the 60-day ratio, and sector-relative 3-month momentum provides cleaner cross-sectional ranking than volatility-momentum divergence. This approach acknowledges data limitations while building on the IC improvement observed in the current experiment."

The IC improvement suggests the factors capture some predictive signal, but the portfolio implementation suffers from higher volatility and drawdown, indicating the signals may be noisy or require better risk management.

However, the current implementation uses only technical proxies without actual fundamental data (no earnings quality metrics, accruals ratios, cash flow data, or analyst estimates). The three factors implemented are: (1) Momentum_Reversal_Divergence_12M_1M - a pure momentum divergence measure, (2) Volume_Price_Efficiency_Ratio_60D - a volume-weighted price efficiency metric attempting to proxy beta-adjusted returns, and (3) Price_Volatility_Momentum_Divergence_20D - a price-volatility divergence attempting to proxy analyst dispersion. While IC improved, suggesting these technical patterns have some predictive power, the deterioration in portfolio metrics (lower return, worse IR, larger drawdown) indicates that: (a) technical proxies cannot adequately substitute for actual fundamental data, (b) the divergence signals may be capturing noise rather than true fundamental-technical disconnects, or (c) the factors lack the sophistication to distinguish between mean-reversion and continuation regimes as hypothesized.

Rationale: (1) The improved IC (0.013298) demonstrates that technical patterns can capture predictive signals, but the poor portfolio metrics suggest overcomplexity or noise. (2) Rather than attempting to proxy fundamental metrics (accruals, analyst estimates) through convoluted technical constructs, we should focus on what technical data does well: identifying momentum quality and persistence. (3) The new approach simplifies to three core components: momentum consistency (correlation between different timeframes to identify stable trends), volume confirmation (to separate real moves from noise), and cross-sectional strength (to identify relative winners). (4) By reducing complexity and focusing on proven momentum factors with quality filters, we can potentially achieve better risk-adjusted returns while maintaining or improving IC. (5) The 6-month/1-month correlation replaces the complex 12-1 month divergence, the 20-day volume-weighted efficiency simplifies the 60-day ratio, and sector-relative 3-month momentum provides cleaner cross-sectional ranking than volatility-momentum divergence.

        "observations": "The combined factor demonstrates strong performance across most metrics. The annualized return (0.075795 vs 0.052010) shows a 45.8% improvement over SOTA, and the Information Ratio (1.005646 vs 0.972561) indicates better risk-adjusted returns. The IC metric (0.016604 vs 0.005798) shows nearly 3x improvement in predictive power. However, the max drawdown (-0.120828 vs -0.072585) deteriorated by 66.5%, indicating higher tail risk. All three component factors were successfully implemented and tested together.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is PARTIALLY SUPPORTED with important caveats. The combination of sector-relative spread volatility, asymmetric volume-price discovery, and momentum divergence does generate superior returns (75.8 bps annualized vs 52.0 bps SOTA). The IC improvement suggests these signals capture genuine predictive information about short-term returns. However, the significantly worse max drawdown indicates the strategy experiences more severe losses during adverse market conditions, suggesting the factors may be capturing risk premia rather than pure alpha. The hypothesis's focus on 'liquidity quality exceeding sector median' as an amplification mechanism was not explicitly tested in the current implementation - the factors were combined additively without conditional logic based on dollar volume thresholds. This represents a key untested component of the original hypothesis.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current approach shows strong return generation but poor drawdown control, suggesting several refinements: (1) SIMPLIFICATION: Replace complex asymmetric volume-price discovery with simpler volume-momentum correlation to reduce overfitting risk and improve interpretability. (2) RISK MANAGEMENT: The 66.5% worse drawdown is unacceptable for practical implementation - add explicit volatility normalization to each component to control tail risk. (3) LIQUIDITY FILTER: Implement the originally hypothesized liquidity quality filter as a multiplicative gate rather than additive component, which should reduce exposure during illiquid periods when drawdowns are most severe. (4) PARAMETER OPTIMIZATION: Extend spread volatility window from 5 to 10 days for more stable signal, and adjust momentum windows (240/20 to 60/20) to reduce lookback period and improve signal freshness. (5) SECTOR ADJUSTMENT: Replace cross-sectional RANK/ZSCORE with explicit sector z-scoring to better capture sector-relative effects as originally intended. These changes maintain the theoretical framework while addressing the drawdown issue and simplifying factor construction for better generalization."

The adaptive approach maintains the strong IC and return performance while building in more defensive characteristics. By rebalancing toward quality (40% vs 30%) and reducing momentum exposure (30% vs 40%), the factor should achieve better risk-adjusted returns with lower drawdowns.

The max drawdown slightly worsened from -7.26% to -8.03% (+10.6%), which is acceptable given the substantial gains in return metrics. All three factors were successfully implemented and tested, providing comprehensive validation of the hypothesis framework.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is STRONGLY SUPPORTED by empirical results. The multi-component approach successfully captures microstructure inefficiencies through delayed sector response patterns, with the lead-lag correlation mechanism proving particularly effective (evidenced by the dramatic IC improvement). The momentum-reversal divergence (240-day vs 20-day) combined with volume efficiency filtering demonstrates robust signal extraction. The volatility regime transition weighting effectively identifies stable periods for momentum persistence. However, the slightly increased drawdown suggests the factors may benefit from additional risk controls or position sizing refinements. The hypothesis framework is sound and warrants further exploration through methodological refinement rather than directional changes.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "The current hypothesis demonstrates strong empirical support, but can be optimized through strategic simplification: (1) REDUCE LOOKBACK COMPLEXITY: The 240-day momentum window may introduce excessive historical dependency - testing 120-day could maintain trend capture while improving adaptability. Similarly, reducing the short-term window from 20 to 10 days may sharpen reversal detection. (2) SIMPLIFY VOLUME EFFICIENCY: The current 20-day volume efficiency calculation can be shortened to 10 days to reduce lag and improve responsiveness to recent regime changes. (3) STREAMLINE VOLATILITY REGIME: Instead of the complex 20-day vs 40-day ratio, use a simpler rolling 30-day volatility normalization to reduce parameter count while maintaining regime awareness. (4) MAINTAIN CORE MECHANISMS: Preserve the proven lead-lag correlation structure and volume-to-range efficiency concept, as these drive the strong IC performance. (5) RISK MANAGEMENT: The simplified approach should naturally reduce drawdown through faster adaptation to changing market conditions. This refinement maintains the theoretical foundation while reducing overfitting risk through fewer parameters and shorter lookback periods, potentially improving out-of-sample generalization."

The new hypothesis addresses this by: (1) Further reducing momentum weight in turbulent regimes from 0.3 to 0.2 to minimize exposure to potentially unstable price trends, (2) Introducing volatility-normalized momentum in turbulent regimes to reward risk-adjusted returns rather than absolute returns, and (3) Amplifying the return consistency component (1.0 → 1.5 weight) in turbulent regimes to prioritize stable, high-quality stocks. This refinement maintains the strong predictive power demonstrated in quiet and transition regimes while adding a more defensive posture during market stress. The approach stays within the same theoretical framework of regime-adaptive quality-momentum but fine-tunes the regime-specific behavior to balance return generation with risk control. The simplicity of the adjustment (modifying weights and adding volatility normalization only in turbulent regimes) minimizes the risk of overfitting while directly addressing the observed drawdown weakness."

Consolidating to two aligned windows (15D, 40D) reduces parameter count and improves interpretability. (2) CORE MECHANISM FOCUS: The liquidity efficiency differential and volatility regime transition appear to be the primary alpha drivers based on the strong IC improvement. The range compression signal (RCS) may be redundant or add noise. (3) UNIFIED METRIC: Using the same base metric (price-range-to-volume ratio) for both components creates a more coherent factor that measures regime shifts in a single liquidity-volatility characteristic rather than combining three separate signals. (4) PARAMETER ALIGNMENT: The 15D/40D window pair maintains the short-to-medium term relationship (ratio ~2.67) similar to the original 5D/20D (ratio 4.0) and 20D/60D (ratio 3.0) combinations, but with a single consistent timeframe.

(2) The quality filters (return consistency and volume stability) may be too restrictive, potentially filtering out profitable opportunities or creating concentration risk. (3) The momentum divergence component, while theoretically sound, may introduce timing issues or volatility sensitivity that amplifies drawdowns. The hypothesis framework is valid but requires complete implementation and weight optimization.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current approach suffers from three critical issues: (1) INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION - the core 'delayed response' component (50% weight in hypothesis) was never implemented, making the test invalid for the full hypothesis. (2) OVER-SEGMENTATION - separating return consistency and volume stability into two factors adds complexity without clear benefit; a single quality metric would be more robust. (3) MOMENTUM DIVERGENCE ISSUES - the volatility-adjusted momentum divergence (60d vs 20d) may be too sensitive and contribute to the doubled max drawdown. The new hypothesis addresses these by: (a) Consolidating quality metrics into a single Sharpe-like ratio that naturally combines return stability and magnitude, (b) Implementing the missing asymmetric response component with simplified 5-day and 20-day windows focusing on sector correlations (more reliable than supplier/customer/commodity data which may have availability issues), (c) Removing the problematic momentum divergence component that appears to amplify drawdowns, (d) Adjusting weights to emphasize the lead-lag response mechanism (60%) which is the core insight about information transmission inefficiencies. This simpler structure should improve both IC stability and portfolio metrics by reducing overfitting risk and focusing on the most robust signals."

The factor's mathematical structure is relatively concise with reasonable complexity - it combines two distinct volatility regime signals through multiplication, which is theoretically sound for capturing simultaneous regime transitions.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is STRONGLY SUPPORTED by the empirical results. The composite factor successfully identifies stocks experiencing simultaneous macro volatility regime transitions and microstructure liquidity anomalies, as evidenced by: (1) Significant IC improvement (26.1%) demonstrates enhanced predictive power for short-term returns; (2) Substantial annualized return increase (47.7%) confirms the economic value of capturing both macro and micro signals; (3) The multiplicative interaction mechanism effectively captures the alignment of both dimensions. The deterioration in max drawdown suggests the factor captures higher-risk opportunities during regime transitions, which is consistent with the theoretical framework. The 60-day macro window and 8-day micro window appear well-calibrated to capture different time-scale dynamics. The factor construction is appropriately complex without being over-engineered - it uses only 4 base features ($close, $high, $low, $volume) and has a clear theoretical foundation.",

        "reason": "While the current factor shows excellent return characteristics, three refinements can address the increased drawdown while preserving predictive power: (1) ADAPTIVE WINDOWS: Fixed 60-day windows may be suboptimal across different market regimes - using 40-80 day adaptive windows based on recent market volatility (e.g., VIX-like measure) can better capture regime transitions in varying market conditions; (2) MOMENTUM ADJUSTMENT: The current intraday range compression may capture both mean-reversion and momentum signals - adding a 5-day momentum filter can isolate the microstructure liquidity component more precisely; (3) WEIGHTED INTERACTION: Direct multiplication can amplify extreme values leading to larger drawdowns - using exponential weighting (Factor^0.8) can reduce sensitivity to outliers while maintaining the interaction effect. These modifications maintain the hypothesis's core insight while improving robustness. The factor should remain simple with <6 base features and minimal free parameters to avoid overfitting."

While IC improved from 0.005798 to 0.009472 (63% increase), indicating better predictive power at the individual stock level, the portfolio-level metrics deteriorated: annualized return decreased from 5.20% to 4.22%, information ratio dropped from 0.973 to 0.659, and max drawdown worsened from -7.26% to -10.46%. This divergence between IC improvement and portfolio performance decline suggests the factors may be capturing predictive signals but with suboptimal risk-return characteristics or potential overfitting issues. The three proxy factors (Value_Proxy_Price_Momentum_Divergence_60D, Efficiency_Proxy_Volume_Turnover_Stability_45D, Quality_Proxy_Return_Consistency_Score_60D) attempt to approximate fundamental quality-value concepts using only price-volume data, which inherently limits their ability to capture true accounting-based fundamentals like ROE stability, P/E ratios, or cash flow quality.",

The IC improvement suggests directional validity in seeking quality-stability signals, but the portfolio performance decline indicates these proxies lack the robustness of true fundamental metrics. The hypothesis remains theoretically sound but requires either access to fundamental data or a complete reconceptualization to work within price-volume constraints.

        "reason": "Given the data constraints (only daily price-volume data available, no fundamental accounting data), we should pivot from attempting to proxy fundamental quality-value metrics to leveraging well-established anomalies that are natively captured in price-volume data: (1) Low-volatility anomaly: Stocks with lower volatility tend to outperform on a risk-adjusted basis; (2) Quality-momentum: Persistent price strength combined with stability indicates market recognition of quality; (3) Liquidity stability: Consistent volume patterns reduce execution risk and indicate institutional interest. This hypothesis abandons the impossible task of proxying P/E ratios, ROE stability, and cash flow quality from price data alone. Instead, it focuses on what price-volume data naturally reveals: risk-adjusted performance persistence, volatility characteristics, and liquidity patterns. The 120-day window for momentum captures medium-term trends, 60-day volatility provides quarterly stability assessment, and 90-day volume patterns ensure liquidity consistency. This approach aligns with academic evidence on low-volatility and quality-momentum anomalies while working within our data constraints. The factors should be simpler, more interpretable, and less prone to overfitting than complex proxies attempting to mimic unavailable fundamental data."

(2) Simplifying the non-linear transformation from RANK × TS_ZSCORE to just TS_ZSCORE reduces overfitting risk while preserving volatility adjustment—the multiplicative structure likely amplified noise rather than signal. (3) Adding regime-dependent weighting addresses the max drawdown issue by reducing exposure to momentum during high-volatility periods when reversal dominates. This approach maintains the theoretical framework (momentum-reversal hybrid across time scales) while drastically reducing implementation complexity, which should improve the information ratio and reduce drawdown without sacrificing IC gains.

Adjusting for recent returns could filter out these false positives.\n\n3. **Sector-Relative Percentile Rankings**: The current Range_Percentile_Rank_20D uses time-series ranking, but adding cross-sectional sector-relative rankings would better isolate stock-specific microstructure changes from sector-wide movements, improving signal quality.\n\nThese refinements maintain the core hypothesis framework while addressing the drawdown issue and potentially improving the already strong IC.

        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is STRONGLY SUPPORTED by the results. The three-factor combination successfully captures cross-sectional volatility dispersion patterns that predict short-term returns:\n\n1. **Normalized_Range_Compression_10D**: Effectively identifies compression/expansion cycles, with the 10-day lookback capturing meaningful mean-reversion and breakout signals.\n\n2. **Volatility_Clustering_Zscore_8D**: The 8-day clustering window combined with cross-sectional standardization successfully identifies abnormal volatility behavior relative to peers, validating the regime shift detection mechanism.\n\n3. **Range_Percentile_Rank_20D**: The 20-day percentile ranking provides robust extreme identification, complementing the other two factors.\n\nThe substantial IC improvement (+33%) demonstrates that these factors capture genuine predictive signals about market microstructure changes. The increased drawdown suggests the strategy takes more concentrated positions during identified regime shifts, which is consistent with the hypothesis but requires risk management refinement.\n\n**Key Insight**: The combination of different temporal windows (8D, 10D, 20D) and different transformation methods (ratio, z-score, percentile rank) creates a robust multi-dimensional view of volatility patterns that outperforms single-factor approaches.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "While the current factors demonstrate strong predictive power, three specific refinements can address the increased drawdown and further enhance performance:\n\n1. **Asymmetric Volatility Signals**: Current factors treat compression/expansion symmetrically, but market microstructure behaves differently during upward vs downward volatility regimes. Adding directional components (e.g., comparing high-close vs close-low ranges) could reduce false signals and improve risk management.\n\n2. **Momentum-Adjusted Clustering**: The current Volatility_Clustering_Zscore_8D may generate false signals during strong trending periods where high volatility is justified by momentum rather than regime shifts. Adjusting for recent returns could filter out these false positives.\n\n3. **Sector-Relative Percentile Rankings**: The current Range_Percentile_Rank_20D uses time-series ranking, but adding cross-sectional sector-relative rankings would better isolate stock-specific microstructure changes from sector-wide movements, improving signal quality.\n\nThese refinements maintain the core hypothesis framework while addressing the drawdown issue and potentially improving the already strong IC. The goal is to preserve the 64% return improvement while reducing the drawdown closer to SOTA levels through better signal filtering."

        "observations": "The current combined factor shows mixed performance compared to SOTA. While it achieves higher annualized return (0.0636 vs 0.0520, +22.3%) and IC (0.0081 vs 0.0058, +39.4%), it suffers from significantly worse max drawdown (-0.1088 vs -0.0726, -50% worse) and slightly lower information ratio (0.954 vs 0.973, -2%). The improved IC and annualized return suggest the hypothesis has merit in capturing predictive signals, but the deteriorated risk metrics (max drawdown) indicate the factor combination may be capturing volatile regime shifts without adequate risk control. The three-factor combination successfully identifies tail risk and microstructure transitions, but the extreme drawdown suggests these signals may be too concentrated in high-volatility periods.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is PARTIALLY SUPPORTED. The combination of volume-weighted return skewness (20D), normalized range percentile (10D), and range volatility clustering (8D) demonstrates predictive power through improved IC and annualized returns, validating that tail risk repricing and microstructure transitions contain actionable information. However, the 50% worse max drawdown reveals a critical weakness: the current implementation may be over-sensitive to extreme regime shifts, leading to concentrated exposure during market stress periods. The hypothesis framework is sound, but the factor construction needs refinement to balance signal capture with risk management. Key issues: (1) The 20-day window for skewness may be too long, causing delayed reaction to regime changes; (2) The 10-day range percentile and 8-day volatility clustering use different lookback periods without clear justification, potentially creating temporal misalignment; (3) No dampening mechanism exists for extreme values that could drive the poor drawdown performance.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The new hypothesis maintains the core theoretical framework (tail risk + microstructure transitions) but addresses three critical implementation issues: (1) **Window Alignment**: Standardizing all components to 10-day windows ensures temporal coherence and reduces lag in capturing regime shifts. The original 20-day skewness window was too slow to react to rapid market changes. (2) **Noise Reduction**: Replacing simple autocorrelation with exponentially-weighted volatility persistence reduces sensitivity to single-day outliers that likely contributed to the extreme drawdown. (3) **Risk Normalization**: Adding a denominator term that scales signals by recent volatility levels prevents over-concentration in high-volatility periods. This approach preserves the hypothesis's predictive edge (evidenced by superior IC and returns) while addressing the risk control weakness (poor max drawdown). The modifications are methodological refinements within the same theoretical framework rather than a directional change, focusing on robust factor construction through: shorter reaction windows, temporal alignment, noise smoothing, and volatility-adjusted scaling. This iteration prioritizes simplicity and stability over complexity."

However, max drawdown deteriorated from -0.072585 to -0.106067 (+46.1% worse), indicating increased downside risk. The substantial improvements in return-based metrics alongside the IC increase suggest the factors are capturing genuine predictive signals related to correlation regime shifts, though with higher volatility exposure.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis receives STRONG SUPPORT from the implemented factors. The 50% improvement in IC demonstrates that correlation instability metrics effectively predict future returns. The 61% increase in annualized return suggests that regime-dependent correlation changes do indeed signal systematic risk repricing. However, the increased max drawdown (-0.106 vs -0.073) indicates that these signals are associated with higher volatility periods, which aligns with the hypothesis focus on volatility regime transitions. The Rolling_Beta_Volatility_60D (measuring beta instability) and Volatility_Regime_Return_Asymmetry_20D (capturing return asymmetry across regimes) appear to complement each other well. The unimplemented Beta_Dispersion_20D factor should be tested to complete the theoretical framework, as it directly measures the core concept of beta coefficient dispersion between volatility regimes.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "The current results validate the core hypothesis but reveal opportunities for refinement: (1) The deteriorated max drawdown suggests the need for better risk control through directional regime classification (distinguishing market stress from general volatility increases), (2) The strong IC and return improvements indicate the 20-60 day window range is effective, but shorter windows could capture earlier signals, (3) Normalizing beta dispersion by baseline correlation would help distinguish stocks with genuinely unstable systematic risk from those with naturally low correlation, (4) The unimplemented Beta_Dispersion_20D should be simplified and tested as it directly operationalizes the hypothesis, (5) Exploring the interaction between beta volatility (already successful) and return asymmetry (already successful) through multiplicative or conditional factors could amplify signals. The next iteration should focus on: implementing the missing Beta_Dispersion_20D with simplified formulation, adding 10-15 day short-term variants, incorporating directional regime classification, and testing normalized versions of existing factors."
