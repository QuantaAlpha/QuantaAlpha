This suggests that while the factors capture some predictive signal (positive IC), they fail to translate into superior portfolio performance, indicating potential issues with factor construction, overfitting, or excessive complexity.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis regarding price-volume correlation combined with intraday range asymmetry shows partial validation but with critical limitations. The slight IC improvement (0.006296 vs 0.005798) suggests the theoretical framework has merit in capturing cross-sectional return predictability. However, the significant deterioration in portfolio metrics (annualized return -11.4%, information ratio -29.9%, max drawdown -30.5%) indicates that: (1) The interaction mechanism may be over-engineered, creating noise rather than signal amplification; (2) The 20-day window in the hybrid factor might be suboptimal; (3) The multiplicative interaction of two ranked factors may amplify outliers and create unstable predictions; (4) Range asymmetry normalization using (high-low) denominator may be sensitive to extreme volatility days. The hypothesis direction is promising but requires substantial simplification and refinement in factor construction methodology.",

        "reason": "The new hypothesis maintains the theoretical core—that informed trading manifests in both price-volume dynamics and intraday patterns—but addresses critical implementation issues: (1) **Simplification**: Reduces window lengths (15/20 days → 10 days, 10 days → 5 days) to decrease overfitting risk and improve signal freshness; (2) **Additive vs Multiplicative**: Proposes additive combination instead of multiplicative rank interaction to avoid amplifying noise and outliers; (3) **Direct Measurement**: Simplifies range asymmetry to direct (high-open) - (close-low) difference, eliminating complex ratio normalization that may be unstable; (4) **Volatility Adjustment**: Suggests standardization by recent volatility rather than daily range to improve robustness; (5) **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer parameters and shorter lookback periods should improve generalization. The current factors likely suffer from over-parameterization (multiple window sizes: 10, 15, 20 days; complex nested operations; multiplicative interactions), leading to good in-sample fit but poor out-of-sample performance. The next iteration should focus on the simplest possible implementation that captures the core theoretical insight."

(2) **Momentum Window Optimization**: The 240-day lookback may be too long, causing delayed signals - testing 120-day vs 20-day divergence could capture trends more responsively while maintaining the reversal concept. (3) **Drawdown Mitigation**: The 40% increase in max drawdown is concerning - adding a conditional dampening mechanism (reducing position sizing when volatility regime exceeds 80th percentile) could preserve upside capture while limiting downside. (4) **Volume Quality Enhancement**: Replacing simple volume with VWAP deviation could better identify institutional momentum versus retail noise.

High efficiency periods favor trend-following (short-term), while low efficiency periods favor quality momentum (medium-term).\n\nThis approach maintains the regime-adaptive concept while significantly reducing complexity and improving signal stability for better portfolio implementation."

The improved IC and annualized return suggest the hypothesis has merit in capturing predictive signals, but the deteriorated risk metrics (max drawdown) indicate the factor combination may be capturing volatile regime shifts without adequate risk control.

The combination of volume-weighted return skewness (20D), normalized range percentile (10D), and range volatility clustering (8D) demonstrates predictive power through improved IC and annualized returns, validating that tail risk repricing and microstructure transitions contain actionable information. However, the 50% worse max drawdown reveals a critical weakness: the current implementation may be over-sensitive to extreme regime shifts, leading to concentrated exposure during market stress periods. The hypothesis framework is sound, but the factor construction needs refinement to balance signal capture with risk management. Key issues: (1) The 20-day window for skewness may be too long, causing delayed reaction to regime changes; (2) The 10-day range percentile and 8-day volatility clustering use different lookback periods without clear justification, potentially creating temporal misalignment; (3) No dampening mechanism exists for extreme values that could drive the poor drawdown performance.",

The original 20-day skewness window was too slow to react to rapid market changes. (2) **Noise Reduction**: Replacing simple autocorrelation with exponentially-weighted volatility persistence reduces sensitivity to single-day outliers that likely contributed to the extreme drawdown. (3) **Risk Normalization**: Adding a denominator term that scales signals by recent volatility levels prevents over-concentration in high-volatility periods. This approach preserves the hypothesis's predictive edge (evidenced by superior IC and returns) while addressing the risk control weakness (poor max drawdown). The modifications are methodological refinements within the same theoretical framework rather than a directional change, focusing on robust factor construction through: shorter reaction windows, temporal alignment, noise smoothing, and volatility-adjusted scaling. This iteration prioritizes simplicity and stability over complexity."

(2) **Component Redundancy**: Removes the trend consistency ratio (TCR_30D) which conceptually overlaps with cumulative return - both measure sustained directional movement. (3) **Simplified Weighting**: Reduces from three components (0.40/0.35/0.25) to two (0.65/0.35), giving more weight to the core momentum signal while using price-volume correlation purely for validation. (4) **Fewer Base Features**: Uses only $close and $volume instead of computing multiple derived features. (5) **Theoretical Soundness**: Maintains the core insight that momentum validated by volume flow is more reliable, but implements it more parsimoniously. The 20-day window for correlation aligns with typical monthly trading patterns and avoids the complexity of blending multiple timeframes.

The new hypothesis addresses these by: (a) Shortening timeframes to 5-10 days to capture actionable momentum before mean reversion, (b) Using a single momentum component to eliminate redundancy, (c) Adding a volume surge filter to focus on high-conviction moves, (d) Replacing z-score with rank normalization to bound outliers.

The performance pattern indicates the factor captures profitable signals but with higher volatility and tail risk, which is characteristic of regime-dependent strategies that may experience concentrated losses during regime transitions.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is partially validated but reveals important limitations:\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. The multi-timeframe momentum approach successfully improves return generation (+10.6% annualized return improvement)\n2. IC improvement (+7.8%) confirms the factor's predictive validity\n3. The regime-adaptive weighting mechanism appears to identify profitable trading opportunities\n\n**Critical Weaknesses:**\n1. **Risk Management Failure**: The 29% increase in max drawdown (-0.093670 vs -0.072585) indicates the regime detection mechanism fails to protect capital during adverse market conditions\n2. **Information Ratio Deterioration**: The 8.7% decline in IR (0.888037 vs 0.972561) shows the additional return doesn't compensate for increased volatility\n3. **Regime Transition Risk**: The volatility regime component (120-day mean reversion weighted by volatility percentile changes) may be introducing excessive risk during regime shifts rather than protecting against them\n\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\n- The 5-day momentum weighted by liquidity differential may be too reactive, causing whipsaw losses\n- The 120-day mean reversion signal activated by volatility regime transitions (DELTA(TS_RANK(TS_STD(close, 20), 60), 5)) appears to trigger at precisely the wrong times, entering mean-reversion positions during the start of trend continuations\n- The 8-day range compression ratio lacks directional information and may not effectively distinguish between healthy consolidation and pre-breakout compression\n\n**Complexity Assessment:**\nAll three factors use reasonable complexity levels with appropriate window sizes and rank normalization. However, the interaction between components may be creating unintended risk exposure.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The new hypothesis addresses the critical weaknesses identified:\n\n1. **Eliminate High-Risk Mean Reversion Component**: Remove the 120-day mean reversion signal weighted by volatility regime changes, which appears to be the primary source of drawdown risk. The DELTA(TS_RANK(TS_STD(close, 20), 60), 5) trigger is too sensitive and may cause entries during the most volatile periods.\n\n2. **Simplify Momentum Signal**: Replace 5-day ROC with 10-day ROC to reduce noise and whipsaw trades. This provides a more stable momentum signal while maintaining responsiveness.\n\n3. **Stable Liquidity Filter**: Instead of using liquidity differential as a weighting mechanism (which can amplify risk), use volume consistency (TS_STD(volume, 20) / TS_MEAN(volume, 20)) as a quality filter. This identifies stocks with stable trading patterns that are less prone to liquidity shocks.\n\n4. **Price Efficiency Signal**: Replace the 8-day range compression ratio with a more informative price efficiency metric: the ratio of close-to-close volatility to high-low range. This captures whether price movements are efficient (trending) or noisy (mean-reverting) without introducing regime-dependent complexity.\n\n5. **Risk Management Focus**: By removing regime-dependent weighting and focusing on quality-filtered momentum, the factor should achieve better risk-adjusted returns even if absolute returns are slightly lower. The goal is to improve the information ratio back above 0.95 while maintaining or improving IC.\n\n6. **Reduced Complexity**: Equal weighting of simpler components reduces overfitting risk and parameter sensitivity, leading to more robust out-of-sample performance.\n\nThis hypothesis maintains the core insight that momentum works better in liquid, efficient markets, but implements it through stable quality filters rather than dynamic regime detection, which should reduce drawdown risk and improve the information ratio."

(3) Implement adaptive weighting based on volatility regime to address the max drawdown issue - when volatility clustering is high, reduce flow dynamics weight and increase microstructure filtering to avoid false signals during turbulent periods.

With only ~2 years of data (2020-2021), requiring 240 trading days (~1 year) eliminates most of 2020, leaving insufficient samples.\n\n2. **Liquidity_Adjusted_KLEN_Consistency_15D**: The triple averaging of volume-weighted KLEN ratios may produce numerical instabilities. The denominator (20-day average volume) could be near-zero for illiquid stocks, and the epsilon (1e-8) may be insufficient.\n\n3. **Sector_Relative_Volatility_Efficiency_5D**: Cross-sectional MEDIAN and ZSCORE operations require sufficient instruments per day. If sector filtering or data availability issues reduce cross-sectional coverage, these operations fail.\n\n**Hypothesis Validity Concerns:**\nThe hypothesis assumes that combining three complex signals with activation conditions (momentum alignment + z-score threshold > 0.5) will improve predictability. However, this creates a compound filter that may be too restrictive, eliminating most trading opportunities and resulting in empty factor values.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\nAll three factors exhibit high complexity:\n- Multiple nested operations (TS_MEAN within TS_CORR, triple averaging, z-score of deviations)\n- Long lookback periods (240 days)\n- Cross-sectional operations requiring robust data coverage\n- Multiple conditional activations\n\nThis complexity likely contributes to the failure, as any single component's data insufficiency cascades into complete signal loss.",

(2) PARAMETER ADJUSTMENT - Extending the price residual window from 10 to 12 days and volatility normalization from 20 to 15 days to better align time horizons and reduce parameter count. (3) SIGNAL CLARITY - Replacing volatility 'clustering' (8-day STD of normalized range) with direct 10-day range momentum (change in normalized range), which is more interpretable and less prone to regime-specific patterns. (4) VOLUME CONSISTENCY - Changing from single-day volume filter to 3-day sustained volume requirement to reduce noise from sporadic volume spikes.

With only ~2 years of data (2020-2021), requiring 240 trading days (~1 year) eliminates most of 2020, leaving insufficient samples.\n\n2. **Liquidity_Adjusted_KLEN_Consistency_15D**: The triple averaging of volume-weighted KLEN ratios may produce numerical instabilities. The denominator (20-day average volume) could be near-zero for illiquid stocks, and the epsilon (1e-8) may be insufficient.\n\n3. **Sector_Relative_Volatility_Efficiency_5D**: Cross-sectional MEDIAN and ZSCORE operations require sufficient instruments per day. If sector filtering or data availability issues reduce cross-sectional coverage, these operations fail.\n\n**Hypothesis Validity Concerns:**\nThe hypothesis assumes that combining three complex signals with activation conditions (momentum alignment + z-score threshold > 0.5) will improve predictability. However, this creates a compound filter that may be too restrictive, eliminating most trading opportunities and resulting in empty factor values.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\nAll three factors exhibit high complexity:\n- Multiple nested operations (TS_MEAN within TS_CORR, triple averaging, z-score of deviations)\n- Long lookback periods (240 days)\n- Cross-sectional operations requiring robust data coverage\n- Multiple conditional activations\n\nThis complexity likely contributes to the failure, as any single component's data insufficiency cascades into complete signal loss.",

        "observations": "The current combined factor shows mixed performance compared to SOTA. While it achieves higher annualized return (0.0636 vs 0.0520, +22.3%) and IC (0.0081 vs 0.0058, +39.4%), it suffers from significantly worse max drawdown (-0.1088 vs -0.0726, -50% worse) and slightly lower information ratio (0.954 vs 0.973, -2%). The improved IC and annualized return suggest the hypothesis has merit in capturing predictive signals, but the deteriorated risk metrics (max drawdown) indicate the factor combination may be capturing volatile regime shifts without adequate risk control. The three-factor combination successfully identifies tail risk and microstructure transitions, but the extreme drawdown suggests these signals may be too concentrated in high-volatility periods.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is PARTIALLY SUPPORTED. The combination of volume-weighted return skewness (20D), normalized range percentile (10D), and range volatility clustering (8D) demonstrates predictive power through improved IC and annualized returns, validating that tail risk repricing and microstructure transitions contain actionable information. However, the 50% worse max drawdown reveals a critical weakness: the current implementation may be over-sensitive to extreme regime shifts, leading to concentrated exposure during market stress periods. The hypothesis framework is sound, but the factor construction needs refinement to balance signal capture with risk management. Key issues: (1) The 20-day window for skewness may be too long, causing delayed reaction to regime changes; (2) The 10-day range percentile and 8-day volatility clustering use different lookback periods without clear justification, potentially creating temporal misalignment; (3) No dampening mechanism exists for extreme values that could drive the poor drawdown performance.",

        "reason": "The new hypothesis maintains the core theoretical framework (tail risk + microstructure transitions) but addresses three critical implementation issues: (1) **Window Alignment**: Standardizing all components to 10-day windows ensures temporal coherence and reduces lag in capturing regime shifts. The original 20-day skewness window was too slow to react to rapid market changes. (2) **Noise Reduction**: Replacing simple autocorrelation with exponentially-weighted volatility persistence reduces sensitivity to single-day outliers that likely contributed to the extreme drawdown. (3) **Risk Normalization**: Adding a denominator term that scales signals by recent volatility levels prevents over-concentration in high-volatility periods. This approach preserves the hypothesis's predictive edge (evidenced by superior IC and returns) while addressing the risk control weakness (poor max drawdown). The modifications are methodological refinements within the same theoretical framework rather than a directional change, focusing on robust factor construction through: shorter reaction windows, temporal alignment, noise smoothing, and volatility-adjusted scaling. This iteration prioritizes simplicity and stability over complexity."

The multiplicative interaction of three temporal scales (20-day beta regime dispersion, 60-day price-volume volatility shift, 8-day intraday range compression) successfully identifies profitable trading opportunities, as evidenced by the 25.7% improvement in annualized returns. This validates the core premise that synchronized anomalies across macro, medium, and short-term scales can predict future returns.

        "reason": "The current hypothesis shows strong return generation but exhibits concerning drawdown characteristics and marginal IC degradation. Four key observations motivate the refinement: (1) The 20-day beta dispersion component, while theoretically sound, may introduce excessive complexity by requiring regime filtering and differential standard deviation calculations, potentially capturing noise alongside signal. (2) The multiplicative interaction amplifies extreme values, which could explain the larger drawdowns—a more balanced additive approach may provide smoother factor behavior. (3) The 60-day delta in price-volume volatility percentile rank is a second-order derivative (change in rank), which may be overly sensitive to short-term fluctuations. (4) Simplification to dual-scale (medium + short) rather than triple-scale (macro + medium + short) can reduce overfitting risk while maintaining the core insight about multi-temporal coordination. The new hypothesis proposes: (a) Replace beta regime dispersion with a simpler 30-day rolling correlation between price volatility and volume volatility to capture medium-term microstructure stability without regime filtering complexity. (b) Replace the 60-day delta of percentile rank with direct percentile rank to reduce second-order sensitivity. (c) Use 10-day percentile rank of normalized intraday range instead of 8-day z-score to maintain consistency in scaling methods. (d) Combine factors additively with equal weighting to reduce outlier amplification. This approach maintains the multi-scale temporal coordination concept while simplifying implementation, potentially improving robustness and reducing drawdowns."

The new hypothesis addresses these by: (a) Shortening timeframes to 5-10 days to capture actionable momentum before mean reversion, (b) Using a single momentum component to eliminate redundancy, (c) Adding a volume surge filter to focus on high-conviction moves, (d) Replacing z-score with rank normalization to bound outliers.

While IC improved from 0.005798 to 0.010070 (73.7% increase), indicating better predictive power at the stock level, the portfolio-level metrics deteriorated significantly: annualized return decreased from 5.20% to 2.91% (44% decline), information ratio dropped from 0.973 to 0.369 (62% decline), and max drawdown nearly doubled from -7.26% to -13.43%.

(2) The quality filters (return consistency and volume stability) may be too restrictive, potentially filtering out profitable opportunities or creating concentration risk.

(2) OVER-SEGMENTATION - separating return consistency and volume stability into two factors adds complexity without clear benefit; a single quality metric would be more robust. (3) MOMENTUM DIVERGENCE ISSUES - the volatility-adjusted momentum divergence (60d vs 20d) may be too sensitive and contribute to the doubled max drawdown. The new hypothesis addresses these by: (a) Consolidating quality metrics into a single Sharpe-like ratio that naturally combines return stability and magnitude, (b) Implementing the missing asymmetric response component with simplified 5-day and 20-day windows focusing on sector correlations (more reliable than supplier/customer/commodity data which may have availability issues), (c) Removing the problematic momentum divergence component that appears to amplify drawdowns, (d) Adjusting weights to emphasize the lead-lag response mechanism (60%) which is the core insight about information transmission inefficiencies. This simpler structure should improve both IC stability and portfolio metrics by reducing overfitting risk and focusing on the most robust signals."

Replacing multiplication with volatility-adjusted ranking maintains the quality-filtering concept while preventing outliers. (2) The 10-day window in Opening_Gap_Persistence is likely too short for institutional accumulation patterns, which typically develop over 3-4 weeks; extending to 20 days aligns better with monthly portfolio rebalancing cycles. (3) The 252-day vs 21-day momentum comparison spans a full year versus one month, creating excessive sensitivity to annual regime shifts; using 126-day (half-year) vs 21-day maintains the divergence concept with better stability. (4) The hypothesis mentions volume stability but it wasn't explicitly implemented as a filter - adding this as a binary quality gate will improve factor robustness. These modifications maintain the core theoretical insight while addressing the practical risk management deficiencies revealed by the max drawdown metric."

However, the marginal IC decrease and increased drawdown suggest the filtering may be too aggressive or the factor construction too complex.

(3) Simplifying to two layers with shorter, more responsive windows (10-day liquidity, 30-day momentum, 40-day regime) should maintain the filtering benefit while improving adaptability. (4) Using inverse volume-weighted range directly as a quality score is more interpretable than a ratio of two moving averages. (5) The sector adjustment via median subtraction proved valuable and should be retained. (6) Reducing from three multiplicative components to two should decrease drawdown sensitivity while preserving the core signal quality filtering concept.

(2) **Component Redundancy**: Removes the trend consistency ratio (TCR_30D) which conceptually overlaps with cumulative return - both measure sustained directional movement. (3) **Simplified Weighting**: Reduces from three components (0.40/0.35/0.25) to two (0.65/0.35), giving more weight to the core momentum signal while using price-volume correlation purely for validation. (4) **Fewer Base Features**: Uses only $close and $volume instead of computing multiple derived features. (5) **Theoretical Soundness**: Maintains the core insight that momentum validated by volume flow is more reliable, but implements it more parsimoniously. The 20-day window for correlation aligns with typical monthly trading patterns and avoids the complexity of blending multiple timeframes. This simpler structure should improve generalization and portfolio stability while preserving predictive power."

        "hypothesis": "Hypothesis: Stocks exhibiting synchronized anomalies across three temporal scales—macro-level beta volatility dispersion between high and low volatility regimes (20-day rolling window), medium-term price-to-volume volatility percentile rank shifts (60-day delta), and short-term intraday range compression (8-day z-score)—will predict future returns, where the multiplicative interaction of regime-based correlation instability with composite microstructure signals identifies securities undergoing coordinated systematic risk transitions and liquidity provision pattern changes.\n                Concise Observation: Parent 1 achieved RankIC=0.0288 by detecting correlation instability through beta dispersion across volatility regimes, while Parent 2 achieved RankIC=0.0303 by combining price-volume volatility percentiles with intraday range compression; both strategies capture different aspects of market regime changes—Parent 1 focuses on systematic risk transitions while Parent 2 emphasizes microstructure and liquidity anomalies—suggesting that fusing macro correlation dynamics with micro price-volume patterns across multiple timeframes (60-day, 20-day, 8-day) could create a more robust signal by requiring simultaneous confirmation across systematic and idiosyncratic dimensions.\n                Concise Justification: The fusion is theoretically justified because regime transitions in systematic risk (captured by time-varying beta instability) should manifest in both correlation structure changes and liquidity provision patterns; by requiring simultaneous anomalies in beta dispersion (macro systematic risk), price-volume volatility shifts (meso information flow), and intraday range compression (micro liquidity), the multiplicative interaction creates a stringent filter that identifies only those stocks where regime changes are confirmed across multiple information channels and temporal scales, reducing noise from isolated anomalies while capturing genuine structural transitions where market participants coordinate reassessments of fundamental valuations.\n                Concise Knowledge: When systematic risk exposure exhibits regime-dependent instability (measured by beta coefficient dispersion across volatility states) and this macro-level transition coincides with medium-term price-volume volatility structure anomalies and short-term intraday range compression, the convergence of these multi-scale signals across different information frequencies indicates informed market participants are simultaneously reassessing both systematic risk premiums and stock-specific liquidity conditions, creating predictive power through the identification of structural regime transitions that manifest consistently across macro correlation dynamics, meso liquidity patterns, and micro price formation processes.\n                concise Specification: The factor combines three components with specific windows: (1) Beta_Dispersion_20D measuring the standard deviation of 20-day rolling beta coefficients calculated separately during high-volatility days (top 33% of 60-day rolling volatility) versus low-volatility days (bottom 33%), (2) Price_Volume_Volatility_Percentile_Delta_60D measuring the 60-day change in percentile rank of the ratio between 5-day price standard deviation and 5-day volume standard deviation, and (3) Intraday_Range_Compression_ZSCORE_8D measuring the 8-day z-score of the ratio (high-low)/close; the final factor is the multiplicative interaction of Beta_Dispersion_20D with the sum of the normalized Price_Volume_Volatility_Percentile_Delta_60D and Intraday_Range_Compression_ZSCORE_8D, expecting positive predictive relationships where high values indicate regime transition states with coordinated systematic and microstructure anomalies.\n                ",

The IC decreased slightly by 5.5% (0.005480 vs 0.005798), indicating marginally weaker predictive correlation. The overall performance profile shows a trade-off: higher returns and better risk-adjusted performance at the cost of larger drawdowns and slightly weaker prediction accuracy.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis receives PARTIAL SUPPORT with important caveats. The multiplicative interaction of three temporal scales (20-day beta regime dispersion, 60-day price-volume volatility shift, 8-day intraday range compression) successfully identifies profitable trading opportunities, as evidenced by the 25.7% improvement in annualized returns. This validates the core premise that synchronized anomalies across macro, medium, and short-term scales can predict future returns. However, the increased max drawdown (-0.087515 vs -0.072585) suggests the factor may be capturing regime transitions that include both profitable opportunities and sharp reversals. The slightly lower IC (0.005480 vs 0.005798) indicates the factor's predictive power is more concentrated in specific market conditions rather than being uniformly strong. The three-component structure appears sound, but the balance between components may need refinement to reduce tail risk while maintaining return generation.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "The current hypothesis shows strong return generation but exhibits concerning drawdown characteristics and marginal IC degradation. Four key observations motivate the refinement: (1) The 20-day beta dispersion component, while theoretically sound, may introduce excessive complexity by requiring regime filtering and differential standard deviation calculations, potentially capturing noise alongside signal. (2) The multiplicative interaction amplifies extreme values, which could explain the larger drawdowns—a more balanced additive approach may provide smoother factor behavior. (3) The 60-day delta in price-volume volatility percentile rank is a second-order derivative (change in rank), which may be overly sensitive to short-term fluctuations. (4) Simplification to dual-scale (medium + short) rather than triple-scale (macro + medium + short) can reduce overfitting risk while maintaining the core insight about multi-temporal coordination. The new hypothesis proposes: (a) Replace beta regime dispersion with a simpler 30-day rolling correlation between price volatility and volume volatility to capture medium-term microstructure stability without regime filtering complexity. (b) Replace the 60-day delta of percentile rank with direct percentile rank to reduce second-order sensitivity. (c) Use 10-day percentile rank of normalized intraday range instead of 8-day z-score to maintain consistency in scaling methods. (d) Combine factors additively with equal weighting to reduce outlier amplification. This approach maintains the multi-scale temporal coordination concept while simplifying implementation, potentially improving robustness and reducing drawdowns."

        "observations": "The current multi-regime liquidity-volatility framework shows significantly weaker performance compared to SOTA across all metrics. The annualized return (0.030064 vs 0.052010), information ratio (0.471700 vs 0.972561), and IC (0.004957 vs 0.005798) are all substantially lower, while max drawdown is worse (-0.084119 vs -0.072585). This indicates that the complex combination of liquidity-adjusted volatility ratios, volume-weighted return moments, and intraday range percentile metrics is not effectively capturing profitable trading signals. The framework's theoretical sophistication has not translated into practical predictive power, suggesting potential issues with signal dilution, overfitting to training data, or misalignment between the theoretical constructs and actual market dynamics.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis that combining liquidity-adjusted volatility ratios, volume-weighted return distribution characteristics, and microstructure stability metrics would identify efficient price discovery regimes is NOT supported by the results. The framework underperforms SOTA by approximately 42% in annualized return and 51% in information ratio. Key issues: (1) The liquidity-adjusted volatility ratio (range/volume) may be capturing noise rather than informed trading, as high volatility with low volume could indicate illiquidity rather than efficiency. (2) Volume-weighted skewness over 20 days may be too slow to capture actionable signals and could be contaminated by outlier days. (3) The intraday range percentile stability metric using TS_RANK within TS_STD creates a complex nested structure that may be overfitting. The combination of three sophisticated factors appears to create signal interference rather than complementary information. The framework's complexity (multiple normalization layers, nested time-series operations) likely contributes to overfitting and poor generalization.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The new hypothesis pivots toward simplicity and interpretability while maintaining focus on liquidity-informed price discovery. Key changes: (1) Replace complex liquidity-adjusted volatility ratios with straightforward volume-normalized momentum - if returns are high relative to volume rank, it suggests efficient price discovery. (2) Replace volume-weighted skewness/kurtosis with a simpler intraday range efficiency metric (|return|/range) that directly measures whether price moves are directional vs noisy. (3) Replace the complex nested TS_RANK stability metric with simple volume acceleration to capture emerging liquidity trends. This approach reduces complexity dramatically while maintaining the core insight that liquidity quality matters for price discovery. Each component is independently interpretable and less prone to overfitting. The 10-day momentum window is shorter than previous 20-day windows to capture more timely signals. The framework avoids nested operations and excessive normalization layers that likely caused the current poor performance."

These modifications maintain the core convergence logic (regime + momentum + coordination) while adding risk-aware scaling layers. The approach preserves the validated 60-day, 40-day, and 30-day windows that have proven effective, avoiding unnecessary parameter changes.

However, the increased max drawdown suggests that the current implementation may be too aggressive during market stress periods, indicating a need for enhanced risk controls rather than abandoning the approach. The momentum divergence component (12M-1M) appears particularly effective, as evidenced by the strong IC improvement.

The new hypothesis maintains the three successful core components (momentum divergence, liquidity-adjusted volatility, price-volume patterns) while adding targeted enhancements: (1) Dual-threshold volatility regime detection provides more granular market state identification, allowing the factor to adapt more precisely to changing conditions. (2) Explicit drawdown protection through position scaling directly addresses the max drawdown concern without compromising the signal generation logic. (3) Simplifying price-volume coordination from 15-day correlation to 10-day volume surge patterns reduces computational complexity and potential overfitting while maintaining the essence of institutional participation detection. (4) Asymmetric signal strength based on volatility regimes allows the factor to be more aggressive in favorable conditions and more defensive in risky periods, which should improve risk-adjusted returns. This approach preserves the validated momentum divergence and liquidity efficiency signals while adding defensive mechanisms to control downside risk, targeting a better balance between return generation and risk management."

The new hypothesis simplifies the approach by: (1) Replacing the three-layer hierarchical structure with a two-component multiplicative model to reduce parameter sensitivity; (2) Using Sharpe-like momentum quality (return/volatility ratio) instead of return spread and separate volatility rank, which directly captures risk-adjusted performance; (3) Consolidating volume stability and price-volume correlation into a single activity validation metric; (4) Removing the 12M-1M return spread component that may cause regime-dependent instability. This simpler structure should maintain predictive power while improving stability and reducing overfitting risk. The focus shifts from filtering and divergence detection to direct measurement of sustainable momentum quality."

Replacing multiplication with volatility-adjusted ranking maintains the quality-filtering concept while preventing outliers. (2) The 10-day window in Opening_Gap_Persistence is likely too short for institutional accumulation patterns, which typically develop over 3-4 weeks; extending to 20 days aligns better with monthly portfolio rebalancing cycles. (3) The 252-day vs 21-day momentum comparison spans a full year versus one month, creating excessive sensitivity to annual regime shifts; using 126-day (half-year) vs 21-day maintains the divergence concept with better stability. (4) The hypothesis mentions volume stability but it wasn't explicitly implemented as a filter - adding this as a binary quality gate will improve factor robustness.

(3) **Risk Normalization**: Adding a denominator term that scales signals by recent volatility levels prevents over-concentration in high-volatility periods. This approach preserves the hypothesis's predictive edge (evidenced by superior IC and returns) while addressing the risk control weakness (poor max drawdown). The modifications are methodological refinements within the same theoretical framework rather than a directional change, focusing on robust factor construction through: shorter reaction windows, temporal alignment, noise smoothing, and volatility-adjusted scaling. This iteration prioritizes simplicity and stability over complexity."

The max drawdown increased by 23.5% (from -0.072585 to -0.089619), which is the only metric showing deterioration.

The three implemented factors - Shadow_Asymmetry_Momentum_Filter_10D, Sector_Relative_Volatility_Zscore_5D, and Momentum_Spread_252D_21D - collectively demonstrate that the hypothesis framework is valid and effective.",

The missing fourth component (Amihud illiquidity-adjusted price efficiency) should be implemented to complete the hypothesis test. The current three-factor combination already outperforms SOTA significantly, suggesting the theoretical framework is sound. The factors are relatively simple in construction (each uses 3-5 base features with minimal parameters), which supports good generalization. The increased max drawdown suggests the factors may be capturing higher-risk opportunities that require additional risk management or the liquidity adjustment component to stabilize.",

The next iteration should: (1) Complete the hypothesis by implementing the fourth liquidity/price efficiency component, simplified from the original Amihud illiquidity measure to a more tractable volume-weighted price efficiency metric that captures similar price discovery dynamics without excessive complexity. (2) Address the increased max drawdown by incorporating volatility-based weighting (60-day volatility quintiles) instead of market cap quintiles, which should provide better risk adjustment. (3) Simplify the liquidity measure from 'Amihud illiquidity-adjusted' to 'volume-weighted price efficiency' to avoid potential complexity issues while maintaining the core concept of liquidity-conditional pricing inefficiencies. (4) The new factor should measure how much actual price deviates from its volume-weighted path over 20 days, normalized by typical deviations, which captures price discovery inefficiencies in a simpler, more interpretable way. This approach maintains theoretical consistency while improving practical implementation and risk management."

(2) Replace volume-weighted skewness/kurtosis with a simpler intraday range efficiency metric (|return|/range) that directly measures whether price moves are directional vs noisy. (3) Replace the complex nested TS_RANK stability metric with simple volume acceleration to capture emerging liquidity trends. This approach reduces complexity dramatically while maintaining the core insight that liquidity quality matters for price discovery. Each component is independently interpretable and less prone to overfitting. The 10-day momentum window is shorter than previous 20-day windows to capture more timely signals.

The enhanced information ratio (+7.7%) and annualized return (+46.4%) confirm the hypothesis that regime shifts, sustained directional movement, and trading activity coordination create exploitable signals. However, the significantly larger max drawdown (-61.5% worse) suggests the factor may be capturing higher-risk opportunities or experiencing concentration during market stress periods.

Rather than abandoning the proven theoretical framework, the refinement focuses on three targeted enhancements: (1) Time-decay weighting on regime transitions (10-day decay) to reduce sensitivity to stale signals while maintaining the 60-day context, (2) Volatility-adjusted momentum persistence (20-day rolling vol normalization) to prevent overweighting high-volatility stocks that contribute disproportionately to drawdowns, and (3) Liquidity filtering on price-volume coordination (minimum volume threshold) to exclude thin-traded stocks where coordination signals may be unreliable. These modifications maintain the core convergence logic (regime + momentum + coordination) while adding risk-aware scaling layers. The approach preserves the validated 60-day, 40-day, and 30-day windows that have proven effective, avoiding unnecessary parameter changes. This iterative refinement strategy exhausts variations within the successful framework before considering directional pivots."

(2) Address the increased max drawdown by incorporating volatility-based weighting (60-day volatility quintiles) instead of market cap quintiles, which should provide better risk adjustment. (3) Simplify the liquidity measure from 'Amihud illiquidity-adjusted' to 'volume-weighted price efficiency' to avoid potential complexity issues while maintaining the core concept of liquidity-conditional pricing inefficiencies. (4) The new factor should measure how much actual price deviates from its volume-weighted path over 20 days, normalized by typical deviations, which captures price discovery inefficiencies in a simpler, more interpretable way.

(2) Reduce complexity in volatility indicators - use direct 5-day rolling std of ranges instead of z-score transformation, and shorten range compression to 15 days for more responsive microstructure signals. (3) Implement adaptive weighting based on volatility regime to address the max drawdown issue - when volatility clustering is high, reduce flow dynamics weight and increase microstructure filtering to avoid false signals during turbulent periods. This maintains the successful theoretical framework while improving robustness and reducing tail risk through simpler construction and regime-aware signal combination."

The regime-adaptive multi-timeframe approach successfully improves absolute returns and stock selection (higher annualized return and IC), confirming that directional consistency across nested time windows with volume efficiency does generate superior returns. However, the decreased information ratio suggests the current implementation may not be optimally balancing risk. The three-factor decomposition (short-term volatility regime momentum, long-term trend alignment, and volume efficiency quality) captures different aspects of the hypothesis, but their combination may need refinement. The short-term factor (VRMS) likely drives the volatility regime adaptation, while MWTA captures long-term stability and VEMQ ensures quality filtering. The improved max drawdown indicates better downside protection, supporting the regime-adaptive component. To fully realize the hypothesis's potential, the next iteration should focus on: (1) optimizing the weighting scheme between the three factors to improve information ratio, (2) refining the volatility regime detection mechanism (currently implicit in VRMS through 20-day volatility normalization), and (3) enhancing the hierarchical trend alignment by explicitly measuring cross-timeframe consistency rather than relying on separate short and long-term factors.",

        "reason": "The current results demonstrate that the core hypothesis is sound (improved returns and IC), but the implementation complexity may be limiting risk-adjusted performance. The new hypothesis simplifies the approach by: (1) Making volatility regime detection explicit rather than implicit through normalization, using percentile-based classification for clearer regime separation. (2) Reducing timeframe windows from 4 (3/10/30/90 days) to 2 per regime (5/10 for high vol, 30/60 for low vol), which should reduce overfitting risk and improve generalization. (3) Focusing on the most effective timeframe pairs based on the current results - the short-term VRMS factor likely performs well in volatile markets, while MWTA captures stable trends in calm markets. (4) Simplifying volume efficiency measurement to a single ratio per regime rather than multiple complex interactions. This streamlined approach should maintain the improved annualized return and IC while boosting the information ratio by reducing noise from excessive parameterization. The explicit regime switching mechanism will also make the factor more interpretable and robust to market condition changes."

The annualized return increased from 5.20% to 6.92% (+33%), and the information ratio improved from 0.973 to 1.114 (+14.5%). However, the max drawdown slightly worsened from -7.26% to -7.46%, and IC marginally decreased from 0.005798 to 0.005776 (-0.4%). The component factors (Volume_Price_Correlation_Deviation and Multi_Regime_Liquidity_Efficiency) were successfully implemented and contribute to the hierarchical structure. The hypothesis demonstrates that combining abnormal volume-price correlation patterns with liquidity efficiency regime transitions can capture meaningful alpha signals, though the IC suggests the predictive power at the individual stock-day level remains modest.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is SUPPORTED by the results. The hierarchical approach of first identifying abnormal volume-price correlation spreads (15-day vs 30-day relative to sector medians) and then filtering by multi-regime liquidity efficiency successfully captures liquidity-driven mispricing opportunities. The significant improvement in annualized return (+33%) and information ratio (+14.5%) validates that the combination of these two dimensions provides complementary signals. The component factors work as intended: (1) Volume_Price_Correlation_Deviation identifies stocks with unusual liquidity flow patterns, and (2) Multi_Regime_Liquidity_Efficiency captures favorable microstructure transitions. The hierarchical filtering mechanism effectively isolates stocks where temporary liquidity imbalances coincide with improving market quality. However, the modest IC (0.005776) and slightly worse max drawdown suggest the factor may benefit from refinement in signal strength and risk control.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "The current factor achieves strong returns but shows three areas for improvement: (1) The fixed z-score threshold of 1.5 may not adapt well to varying market conditions - using volatility-adjusted thresholds could improve robustness. (2) Simple high-low ranges are susceptible to noise from intraday extremes - volume-weighting the price ranges would better capture true liquidity-adjusted volatility. (3) The factor lacks directional confirmation - adding a trend requirement for the liquidity efficiency ratio would filter out false signals where the ratio is high but deteriorating. (4) The slight IC decline suggests potential overfitting to specific market regimes - cross-sectional rank normalization would make the factor more stable across different market environments. These refinements maintain the theoretical framework (hierarchical liquidity-flow regime detection) while improving practical implementation through adaptive parameters, noise reduction, momentum confirmation, and better normalization. The goal is to preserve the strong annualized return while improving IC and reducing drawdown through more robust signal construction."
