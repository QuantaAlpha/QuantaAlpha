This approach aligns better with how institutional traders actually operate - they create directional body momentum when executing large orders, and shadow patterns reveal whether the market absorbed or rejected those orders."

This approach aligns better with how institutional traders actually operate - they create directional body momentum when executing large orders, and shadow patterns reveal whether the market absorbed or rejected those orders."

The combination of volume-weighted skewness and kurtosis across 10-day and 20-day windows effectively captures tail risk patterns and extreme event clustering.

The reasoning for refinement: (1) TEMPORAL DYNAMICS: The static 10D and 20D windows capture levels but miss the rate of change in tail risk formation. Adding delta skewness (10D vs 20D difference) identifies accelerating tail risk patterns that signal stronger continuation vs. mean reversion regimes. (2) SIGNAL STABILITY: Raw kurtosis can spike due to single extreme events. Requiring cross-sectional rank stability over 5 days ensures the fat-tail signal represents persistent regime shifts rather than noise. (3) REGIME AWARENESS: The increased drawdown suggests the factor may overexpose during market-wide stress. A volatility dispersion filter (scaling by inverse of cross-sectional volatility standard deviation) reduces exposure when all stocks exhibit high volatility, indicating systematic rather than idiosyncratic risk. (4) SIMPLICITY PRESERVATION: These refinements add interpretable components (delta, stability, regime filter) without significantly increasing complexity, maintaining the factor's core theoretical framework while addressing the drawdown weakness. This approach exhausts variations within the volume-weighted distribution asymmetry framework before considering alternative directions."

        "observations": "The current experiment tests three liquidity stress contrarian factors based on the hypothesis that temporary microstructure deterioration in fundamentally stable stocks creates mean-reversion opportunities. All three factors were successfully implemented and tested. The combined results show significantly weaker performance compared to SOTA across all metrics: annualized return (0.031215 vs 0.052010), information ratio (0.449844 vs 0.972561), max drawdown (-0.137061 vs -0.072585), and IC (0.005393 vs 0.005798). The max drawdown is particularly concerning, nearly doubling the SOTA result, indicating much higher risk. The IC is marginally lower but very close to SOTA, suggesting the factors capture some predictive signal but fail to translate it into superior risk-adjusted returns. The poor information ratio indicates that the signal-to-noise ratio is substantially worse than SOTA, suggesting the factors may be capturing spurious patterns or that the liquidity stress signals are too noisy without proper filtering.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis that liquidity stress combined with fundamental stability creates mean-reversion opportunities receives weak support from these results. While the factors show positive IC (0.005393), indicating some predictive power, the practical trading performance is poor. The key issues appear to be: (1) The volatility spike factor (LSV_5D) may be capturing noise rather than genuine liquidity stress, as 5-day volatility is highly unstable; (2) The volume deterioration signal (VDC_10D) using simple volume averages may not adequately proxy for trade size changes and institutional flow; (3) The price stability anchor (PSA_60D) using intraday range volatility may not effectively capture fundamental value stability or book-to-market characteristics. The combination of these three factors fails to create a robust contrarian signal. The significantly worse max drawdown suggests the factors are generating false signals during genuine market stress periods, leading to losses rather than mean-reversion gains. The hypothesis framework has merit, but the current factor construction methodology is inadequate.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors suffer from three critical weaknesses: (1) Excessive noise in short-term signals - 5-day volatility is too unstable and captures random fluctuations rather than genuine liquidity stress; (2) Inadequate volume proxy - simple volume averages don't account for market-wide volatility changes and fail to isolate institutional flow patterns; (3) Weak fundamental filters - intraday range volatility is influenced by microstructure noise and doesn't effectively proxy for book-to-market stability or earnings quality. The new hypothesis addresses these by: (a) Using high-low spread/volume ratio as a more direct liquidity measure that combines spread and depth dimensions; (b) Employing volume/volatility ratios to normalize for market conditions and better capture genuine trade size changes; (c) Utilizing return autocorrelation and momentum consistency as stronger fundamental stability signals that better reflect valuation anchors. The extended lookback periods (10-day for liquidity, 60-day for volume baseline, 120-day for momentum stability) should reduce noise while maintaining responsiveness to genuine liquidity events. This approach maintains the hypothesis's core insight about temporary liquidity stress in stable stocks while improving signal quality and reducing false positives that caused the poor max drawdown."

The IC is marginally lower but very close to SOTA, suggesting the factors capture some predictive signal but fail to translate it into superior risk-adjusted returns.

The new hypothesis addresses these by: (a) Using high-low spread/volume ratio as a more direct liquidity measure that combines spread and depth dimensions; (b) Employing volume/volatility ratios to normalize for market conditions and better capture genuine trade size changes; (c) Utilizing return autocorrelation and momentum consistency as stronger fundamental stability signals that better reflect valuation anchors. The extended lookback periods (10-day for liquidity, 60-day for volume baseline, 120-day for momentum stability) should reduce noise while maintaining responsiveness to genuine liquidity events.

        "observations": "The combined results show a significant improvement over SOTA across multiple key metrics. The current result achieves an annualized return of 0.101641 (vs SOTA 0.052010, +95.5% improvement), information ratio of 1.555409 (vs SOTA 0.972561, +59.9% improvement), and IC of 0.008167 (vs SOTA 0.005798, +40.9% improvement). However, max drawdown deteriorated to -0.105066 from -0.072585 (-44.7%), indicating higher risk exposure. All three factors were successfully implemented and tested, providing a comprehensive validation of the volatility regime transition hypothesis. The strong IC improvement suggests the factors capture genuine predictive signals about price movements following regime transitions.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is STRONGLY SUPPORTED by the experimental results. The core concept of identifying volatility regime transitions through the STD5/VSTD5 ratio and its percentile rank changes demonstrates clear predictive power. The three factors exploring different temporal windows (20D, 15D, 10D) and measurement approaches (transition detection, divergence measurement, acceleration capture) collectively validate that: (1) The price-to-volume volatility ratio effectively identifies microstructure regime changes; (2) Time-series ranking provides robust normalization for cross-sectional comparison; (3) Both the level (divergence) and changes (transitions/acceleration) in this ratio contain predictive information. The substantial improvement in IC (0.008167 vs 0.005798) confirms these regime transitions predict subsequent price movements. However, the increased max drawdown suggests the factors may be capturing higher-volatility opportunities that require careful risk management.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "The current factors demonstrate strong predictive power but can be optimized through: (1) SIMPLIFICATION - Reducing the number of distinct window parameters (currently using 5, 10, 15, 20 days across factors) to a single optimal range around 12-15 days, which appears to balance signal capture and noise reduction based on the strong performance; (2) NOISE REDUCTION - Adding a short-term smoothing (3-day MA) to the base ratio before ranking, which should reduce spurious regime signals while preserving genuine transitions; (3) RECENCY EMPHASIS - Using exponentially-weighted changes instead of simple deltas to give more weight to recent regime shifts, improving signal timeliness; (4) PARAMETER EFFICIENCY - Consolidating the three separate factors into a single, more robust construction that captures the same regime transition dynamics with fewer degrees of freedom. The 12-15 day window emerged as optimal from the 15D divergence factor's contribution, while the 7-day change window (between the 5D and 10D tested) should provide better balance between responsiveness and stability. This approach maintains the validated theoretical framework while addressing potential overfitting risks through reduced complexity."

This maintains the core microstructure analysis concept while addressing implementation weaknesses. The simplified approach reduces parameter count and focuses on the most predictive aspect: sustained institutional conviction manifested through stable, volume-confirmed body-to-range patterns."

This pattern suggests potential overfitting - the factors capture some return signal but with poor risk-adjusted performance and weak predictive correlation. The dramatically worse drawdown and information ratio indicate the factors are taking on excessive risk without commensurate reward, which is a red flag for practical deployment.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis of using cross-sectional residual-based mean reversion with sector-neutral volatility expectations shows limited validation. While the factors achieve marginally higher raw returns, they fail on risk-adjusted metrics and predictive power (IC).

The severe max drawdown (-0.138713) suggests the mean reversion signals are prone to extended adverse movements, possibly because: (1) the 5-day window is too short to capture stable mean reversion patterns, (2) the volatility standardization may not adequately control for regime changes, (3) volume confirmation thresholds may filter out too many valid signals or fail to distinguish informed vs uninformed trading.

(2) The 5-day window is likely too short for stable mean reversion - markets may need 10-20 days to recognize and correct mispricings. (3) Cross-sectional ranking forces relative positioning which can be problematic when the entire market is trending, diluting absolute signal strength. (4) The poor IC suggests weak predictive power, indicating the factors are not capturing genuine forward-looking information. (5) The volume filtering approach may be too restrictive or may not effectively distinguish between informed and uninformed trading. A simpler approach focusing on medium-term return-to-volatility ratios with absolute thresholds should provide more stable signals with better risk characteristics. By extending the lookback period and simplifying the construction, we can reduce overfitting risk while maintaining the core mean reversion concept. The focus should shift from complex residual calculations to straightforward momentum-volatility relationships that have stronger theoretical foundations and empirical support."

The new hypothesis maintains the proven dual-window framework while adding temporal weighting and momentum dynamics. This addresses the limitation that current factors treat all time periods equally, whereas recent trend quality should be more predictive. The acceleration component adds a second derivative perspective, capturing whether trends are gaining or losing strength, which is crucial for timing. This refinement stays within the validated theoretical framework while adding sophisticated dynamics that could further improve IC and returns without significantly increasing complexity."

        "observations": "The combined factor demonstrates strong performance across most metrics.

The IC metric (0.016604 vs 0.005798) shows nearly 3x improvement in predictive power. However, the max drawdown (-0.120828 vs -0.072585) deteriorated by 66.5%, indicating higher tail risk. All three component factors were successfully implemented and tested together.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is PARTIALLY SUPPORTED with important caveats. The combination of sector-relative spread volatility, asymmetric volume-price discovery, and momentum divergence does generate superior returns (75.8 bps annualized vs 52.0 bps SOTA). The IC improvement suggests these signals capture genuine predictive information about short-term returns. However, the significantly worse max drawdown indicates the strategy experiences more severe losses during adverse market conditions, suggesting the factors may be capturing risk premia rather than pure alpha. The hypothesis's focus on 'liquidity quality exceeding sector median' as an amplification mechanism was not explicitly tested in the current implementation - the factors were combined additively without conditional logic based on dollar volume thresholds. This represents a key untested component of the original hypothesis.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current approach shows strong return generation but poor drawdown control, suggesting several refinements: (1) SIMPLIFICATION: Replace complex asymmetric volume-price discovery with simpler volume-momentum correlation to reduce overfitting risk and improve interpretability. (2) RISK MANAGEMENT: The 66.5% worse drawdown is unacceptable for practical implementation - add explicit volatility normalization to each component to control tail risk. (3) LIQUIDITY FILTER: Implement the originally hypothesized liquidity quality filter as a multiplicative gate rather than additive component, which should reduce exposure during illiquid periods when drawdowns are most severe. (4) PARAMETER OPTIMIZATION: Extend spread volatility window from 5 to 10 days for more stable signal, and adjust momentum windows (240/20 to 60/20) to reduce lookback period and improve signal freshness. (5) SECTOR ADJUSTMENT: Replace cross-sectional RANK/ZSCORE with explicit sector z-scoring to better capture sector-relative effects as originally intended. These changes maintain the theoretical framework while addressing the drawdown issue and simplifying factor construction for better generalization."

However, the implementation suffers from critical weaknesses: (1) The dynamic weighting mechanism between components appears suboptimal, creating excessive volatility and drawdowns; (2) The sector-relative normalization mentioned in the hypothesis is not explicitly implemented in any factor, missing a key cross-sectional control mechanism; (3) The fundamental stability screening (book-to-market stability, earnings yield volatility) is completely absent from all three factors, eliminating an important quality filter that could reduce drawdown risk; (4) The factors lack proper volatility normalization and risk controls, leading to concentrated exposures during stress periods.

This approach targets IR improvement toward 1.0+ while maintaining the IC edge, aiming to achieve both better annualized returns and controlled drawdowns through simpler, more robust factor construction."

However, the complete failure to generate results suggests fundamental issues:\n\n**Critical Implementation Problems:**\n1. **Momentum_Regime_Coherence_20D_240D**: The 240-day lookback requirement likely causes massive data loss in the early periods. With only ~2 years of data (2020-2021), requiring 240 trading days (~1 year) eliminates most of 2020, leaving insufficient samples.\n\n2. **Liquidity_Adjusted_KLEN_Consistency_15D**: The triple averaging of volume-weighted KLEN ratios may produce numerical instabilities. The denominator (20-day average volume) could be near-zero for illiquid stocks, and the epsilon (1e-8) may be insufficient.\n\n3. **Sector_Relative_Volatility_Efficiency_5D**: Cross-sectional MEDIAN and ZSCORE operations require sufficient instruments per day. If sector filtering or data availability issues reduce cross-sectional coverage, these operations fail.\n\n**Hypothesis Validity Concerns:**\nThe hypothesis assumes that combining three complex signals with activation conditions (momentum alignment + z-score threshold > 0.5) will improve predictability. However, this creates a compound filter that may be too restrictive, eliminating most trading opportunities and resulting in empty factor values.\n\n**Complexity Analysis:**\nAll three factors exhibit high complexity:\n- Multiple nested operations (TS_MEAN within TS_CORR, triple averaging, z-score of deviations)\n- Long lookback periods (240 days)\n- Cross-sectional operations requiring robust data coverage\n- Multiple conditional activations\n\nThis complexity likely contributes to the failure, as any single component's data insufficiency cascades into complete signal loss.",

The 71% worse max drawdown and 34% lower information ratio indicate the fusion is creating a less stable, riskier portfolio. Key issues: (1) The three factors may be capturing redundant information rather than complementary signals, (2) The 30D trend strength and 60D momentum alignment likely overlap significantly in their signal generation, (3) The volatility-volume efficiency factor's z-score normalization may be creating extreme values that destabilize the combined signal, (4) No sector normalization was actually implemented despite being mentioned in the hypothesis, which could explain poor cross-sectional performance.",

The new hypothesis addresses these by: (a) Shortening timeframes to 5-10 days to capture actionable momentum before mean reversion, (b) Using a single momentum component to eliminate redundancy, (c) Adding a volume surge filter to focus on high-conviction moves, (d) Replacing z-score with rank normalization to bound outliers. This simpler structure should improve information ratio and reduce drawdown while maintaining predictive power through better signal quality rather than quantity."

The max drawdown slightly deteriorated from -0.073 to -0.077 (+5.9%), which is a minor trade-off given the substantial gains in return and risk-adjusted performance.

The 106% improvement in IC indicates the factors are highly predictive of future returns, while the 22% increase in annualized return confirms their practical value.

(2) TEMPORAL SMOOTHING - Applying a 3-day moving average to the intraday volatility deviation z-score reduces noise and captures persistent rather than transient anomalies, improving signal quality. (3) OPTIMIZED TIMEFRAMES - Adjusting momentum windows from 240/20 days to 120/10 days creates more responsive signals while maintaining the divergence concept, and incorporating volume-weighted returns enhances the quality of momentum signals by emphasizing periods with higher trading conviction. These modifications maintain the core theoretical framework while addressing potential noise and parameter optimization, aiming to improve the already strong IC and reduce drawdown through more stable signal generation."

The missing fourth component (Amihud illiquidity-adjusted price efficiency) should be implemented to complete the hypothesis test. The current three-factor combination already outperforms SOTA significantly, suggesting the theoretical framework is sound. The factors are relatively simple in construction (each uses 3-5 base features with minimal parameters), which supports good generalization. The increased max drawdown suggests the factors may be capturing higher-risk opportunities that require additional risk management or the liquidity adjustment component to stabilize.",

The next iteration should: (1) Complete the hypothesis by implementing the fourth liquidity/price efficiency component, simplified from the original Amihud illiquidity measure to a more tractable volume-weighted price efficiency metric that captures similar price discovery dynamics without excessive complexity. (2) Address the increased max drawdown by incorporating volatility-based weighting (60-day volatility quintiles) instead of market cap quintiles, which should provide better risk adjustment. (3) Simplify the liquidity measure from 'Amihud illiquidity-adjusted' to 'volume-weighted price efficiency' to avoid potential complexity issues while maintaining the core concept of liquidity-conditional pricing inefficiencies. (4) The new factor should measure how much actual price deviates from its volume-weighted path over 20 days, normalized by typical deviations, which captures price discovery inefficiencies in a simpler, more interpretable way. This approach maintains theoretical consistency while improving practical implementation and risk management."
