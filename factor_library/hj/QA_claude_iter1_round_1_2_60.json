Direct volume-price momentum measures could be more robust.\n\n2. **Reduce Parameter Sensitivity**: The correlation-based factors (IVC_5D, VPID_20D) depend on specific window choices.

However, IC decreased slightly from 0.005798 to 0.004561 (-21.3%).

The three factors collectively capture liquidity fragmentation and microstructure inefficiencies that translate into superior portfolio performance:\n\n1. **Intraday_Volume_Concentration_5D**: Successfully captures volume clustering during opening/closing periods, providing a 5-day signal of liquidity concentration asymmetry.\n\n2. **Normalized_Spread_Volatility_10D**: Effectively detects abnormal bid-ask spread fluctuations over 10 days, indicating microstructure stress periods.\n\n3. **Volume_Price_Impact_Decay_20D**: Captures persistent order flow imbalances through the 20-day correlation between volume and price impact decay.\n\nThe multi-timeframe approach (5/10/20 days) successfully captures different aspects of market microstructure at varying frequencies. The 57.8% improvement in annualized return and 40.2% improvement in information ratio demonstrate that these signals are highly actionable for portfolio construction. The slight IC reduction suggests the factors work better in combination (portfolio context) than individually, which is consistent with capturing complex microstructure interactions rather than simple linear price predictions.\n\nThe improved max drawdown indicates these factors help avoid periods of extreme market stress, supporting the hypothesis that they capture liquidity fragmentation that precedes adverse price movements.",

Direct volume-price momentum measures could be more robust.\n\n2. **Reduce Parameter Sensitivity**: The correlation-based factors (IVC_5D, VPID_20D) depend on specific window choices. Alternative constructions using moving averages or ranks could be more stable.\n\n3. **Enhance Cross-Sectional Signal**: The slight IC decline suggests room for improvement in stock-level prediction. Adding cross-sectional ranking components could strengthen individual stock signals while maintaining portfolio-level performance.\n\n4. **Balance Complexity and Interpretability**: Simpler factors with clear economic intuition (e.g., volume momentum, spread efficiency) may generalize better to out-of-sample periods.\n\n5. **Intermediate Timeframe Focus**: The 10-day window showed promise (NSV_10D). Exploring 10-15 day factors could capture the sweet spot between short-term noise and long-term trends.\n\nThe new hypothesis maintains the successful microstructure focus while proposing more direct, interpretable factor constructions that should improve both IC and portfolio metrics."

(2) **Refined volatility measurement**: Using 10-day volatility deviation from 60-day average (rather than absolute 20-day volatility) explicitly captures the 'shock' or 'dispersion' concept, making the mean-reversion mechanism clearer. (3) **Optimized volume signal**: Switching from 5-day/60-day ratio to 3-day/20-day median ratio reduces noise and focuses on more recent activity, while using median instead of mean provides robustness to outliers. (4) **Moderate complexity**: The new factor maintains simplicity with clear economic intuition - it identifies stocks where recent volatility is abnormally high relative to their own history (not just cross-sectional peers) and recent trading activity is elevated but not extreme. This should improve generalization while maintaining predictive power. The weighted combination (60/40) reflects the empirical observation that volatility signals tend to be more reliable than volume signals in predicting short-term reversals."

(3) **Optimized volume signal**: Switching from 5-day/60-day ratio to 3-day/20-day median ratio reduces noise and focuses on more recent activity, while using median instead of mean provides robustness to outliers. (4) **Moderate complexity**: The new factor maintains simplicity with clear economic intuition - it identifies stocks where recent volatility is abnormally high relative to their own history (not just cross-sectional peers) and recent trading activity is elevated but not extreme. This should improve generalization while maintaining predictive power.

All three factors were successfully implemented and tested, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the gap-range asymmetry hypothesis.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis receives partial support but reveals important limitations. The factors successfully capture gap-range asymmetry patterns that generate positive excess returns, validating the core concept of information flow imbalances. However, the significant deterioration in max drawdown and IC suggests these patterns may be less stable or more concentrated in specific market regimes than anticipated. The gap-range compression approach appears to identify profitable signals but with higher volatility and drawdown risk. The substantial IC decline (0.005798 → 0.003579) indicates weaker linear predictive power, suggesting the relationship between gap-range asymmetry and returns may be non-linear or regime-dependent. The three factors (20D compression ratio, 40D correlation, 30D expansion frequency) may be capturing overlapping information without sufficient diversification benefits.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors treat all gaps equally regardless of direction or volume context, potentially mixing bullish and bearish signals. The deteriorated max drawdown suggests the factors may be capturing momentum crashes or regime shifts where gap-range patterns reverse. By adding: (1) Volume confirmation - gaps with high volume are more likely to reflect genuine information flow versus noise, (2) Directional separation - positive gaps with narrow ranges may signal different dynamics than negative gaps with narrow ranges, (3) Volatility normalization - adjusting gap-range ratios by recent volatility can make comparisons more meaningful across different volatility regimes and stocks. These refinements maintain the core asymmetry concept while addressing the stability and drawdown issues observed. The approach stays within the theoretical framework but adds contextual filters to improve signal quality. Simpler implementations with fewer overlapping features (reducing from 3 factors to 1-2 refined factors) may also reduce overfitting risk and improve generalization."

The trend consistency filter (proportion of positive days) helps identify sustained directional moves rather than volatile spikes. The theoretical framework is sound: institutional accumulation creates coordinated price-volume patterns that persist, and filtering by trend quality removes noise.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "The current factor successfully validates the core hypothesis but reveals an important trade-off: strong returns come with elevated drawdown risk. To evolve this factor family toward better risk-adjusted performance, we should: (1) Keep the 40-day momentum window as it captures the medium-term institutional accumulation cycle effectively. (2) Enhance price-volume coordination by adding volume acceleration (delta of volume changes) to distinguish between early accumulation (increasing volume with price) and late distribution phases. (3) Introduce volatility normalization to the momentum component, creating a Sharpe-style momentum metric that naturally reduces exposure to high-volatility momentum that often precedes reversals. (4) Replace the fixed 0.55 trend consistency threshold with a cross-sectional ranking approach, making the filter adaptive to market conditions. (5) Consider adding a mean reversion dampener that reduces factor exposure when momentum becomes extreme relative to historical patterns, helping to avoid late-stage momentum crashes. This refinement maintains the theoretical framework (momentum persistence through coordinated price-volume-trend signals) while addressing the practical concern of excessive drawdown through more sophisticated risk controls embedded in the factor construction itself."

Use correlation or consistency metrics across different windows. (2) **Robust Normalization**: Replace division by individual prices (open/low) with division by daily range (high-low), which is more stable and less sensitive to price level effects. This addresses the numerical instability issue.

(5) **Simplicity Maintenance**: Keep factor construction simple with 3-4 base features maximum and minimal free parameters to avoid overfitting.

While IC improved slightly (0.007047 vs 0.005798, +21.5%), the portfolio performance metrics deteriorated significantly: annualized return decreased from 5.20% to 2.99% (-42.5%), information ratio dropped from 0.973 to 0.479 (-50.8%), and max drawdown worsened from -7.26% to -9.85% (-35.7%). This pattern suggests that while the factors capture some predictive signal (positive IC improvement), they fail to translate into profitable trading strategies. The hypothesis about intraday range divergence patterns has some merit (positive IC), but the current implementations are not robust enough for practical portfolio construction. All three factors use relatively simple constructions with reasonable complexity (short lookback windows of 5-20 days, limited base features), which is positive. However, the poor portfolio metrics despite decent IC suggests the factors may be capturing noise or signals that don't survive transaction costs and portfolio construction constraints.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis receives partial support: the improved IC (0.007047 vs 0.005798) confirms that intraday range divergence patterns do contain predictive information about future returns. However, the severe deterioration in portfolio metrics (annualized return -42.5%, information ratio -50.8%, max drawdown -35.7%) indicates critical issues with how this information is being captured. The fundamental insight about information asymmetry and liquidity imbalances reflected in intraday patterns appears valid, but the current factor constructions have three main problems: (1) The normalization methods (dividing by open/low prices with small epsilon) may create unstable signals during low-price regimes; (2) The 5-20 day lookback windows may be too short to distinguish persistent patterns from noise; (3) The factors lack robustness mechanisms to handle extreme values or market regime changes. The divergence between IC improvement and portfolio deterioration suggests the factors are picking up weak signals that get overwhelmed by turnover costs or fail during portfolio optimization.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The new hypothesis refines the original concept by addressing the identified weaknesses while preserving the valid core insight. Key improvements: (1) **Stability Focus**: Instead of raw divergence, emphasize pattern consistency over time to filter noise and capture persistent information asymmetries. Use correlation or consistency metrics across different windows. (2) **Robust Normalization**: Replace division by individual prices (open/low) with division by daily range (high-low), which is more stable and less sensitive to price level effects. This addresses the numerical instability issue. (3) **Multi-Timeframe Validation**: Extend lookback windows to 10-60 days and require pattern persistence across multiple horizons to ensure signals are not just short-term noise. (4) **Volatility Adjustment**: Incorporate volatility normalization to ensure the factor works across different market regimes and volatility environments. (5) **Simplicity Maintenance**: Keep factor construction simple with 3-4 base features maximum and minimal free parameters to avoid overfitting. The improved IC suggests the directional insight is correct; we need to make the signal more stable and tradeable rather than abandoning the concept. Focus on capturing the 'persistence' of asymmetry rather than its instantaneous value."

(2) **Component Redundancy**: Removes the trend consistency ratio (TCR_30D) which conceptually overlaps with cumulative return - both measure sustained directional movement. (3) **Simplified Weighting**: Reduces from three components (0.40/0.35/0.25) to two (0.65/0.35), giving more weight to the core momentum signal while using price-volume correlation purely for validation. (4) **Fewer Base Features**: Uses only $close and $volume instead of computing multiple derived features. (5) **Theoretical Soundness**: Maintains the core insight that momentum validated by volume flow is more reliable, but implements it more parsimoniously. The 20-day window for correlation aligns with typical monthly trading patterns and avoids the complexity of blending multiple timeframes. This simpler structure should improve generalization and portfolio stability while preserving predictive power."

However, the max drawdown deteriorated by 43.1% (-0.103879 vs -0.072585), indicating increased downside risk. The individual component factors (Price_Volume_Volatility_Percentile_Delta_60D and Intraday_Range_Compression_ZSCORE_8D) were also implemented, suggesting the multiplicative interaction adds value beyond individual components. The factor's mathematical structure is relatively concise with reasonable complexity - it combines two distinct volatility regime signals through multiplication, which is theoretically sound for capturing simultaneous regime transitions.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is STRONGLY SUPPORTED by the empirical results. The composite factor successfully identifies stocks experiencing simultaneous macro volatility regime transitions and microstructure liquidity anomalies, as evidenced by: (1) Significant IC improvement (26.1%) demonstrates enhanced predictive power for short-term returns; (2) Substantial annualized return increase (47.7%) confirms the economic value of capturing both macro and micro signals; (3) The multiplicative interaction mechanism effectively captures the alignment of both dimensions. The deterioration in max drawdown suggests the factor captures higher-risk opportunities during regime transitions, which is consistent with the theoretical framework. The 60-day macro window and 8-day micro window appear well-calibrated to capture different time-scale dynamics. The factor construction is appropriately complex without being over-engineered - it uses only 4 base features ($close, $high, $low, $volume) and has a clear theoretical foundation.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "While the current factor shows excellent return characteristics, three refinements can address the increased drawdown while preserving predictive power: (1) ADAPTIVE WINDOWS: Fixed 60-day windows may be suboptimal across different market regimes - using 40-80 day adaptive windows based on recent market volatility (e.g., VIX-like measure) can better capture regime transitions in varying market conditions; (2) MOMENTUM ADJUSTMENT: The current intraday range compression may capture both mean-reversion and momentum signals - adding a 5-day momentum filter can isolate the microstructure liquidity component more precisely; (3) WEIGHTED INTERACTION: Direct multiplication can amplify extreme values leading to larger drawdowns - using exponential weighting (Factor^0.8) can reduce sensitivity to outliers while maintaining the interaction effect. These modifications maintain the hypothesis's core insight while improving robustness. The factor should remain simple with <6 base features and minimal free parameters to avoid overfitting."

The core factor Multi_Horizon_PV_Correlation_15D was NOT implemented, making this an incomplete test of the hypothesis. Despite the incomplete implementation, the results show mixed performance: significantly improved annualized return (0.089 vs 0.052, +71% improvement) and information ratio (1.299 vs 0.973, +34% improvement), but worse max drawdown (-0.103 vs -0.073, +42% worse) and lower IC (0.004 vs 0.006, -30% worse). The strong portfolio metrics (IR, return) combined with weak prediction quality (IC) suggest the factors may be capturing risk premia or regime effects rather than pure predictive signals. The absence of the core price-volume correlation factor means we cannot fully validate the hypothesis about informed trading flow identification.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis cannot be fully validated because the critical Multi_Horizon_PV_Correlation_15D factor was not implemented. The two auxiliary factors (volatility regime filter and volume concentration) alone show strong portfolio construction benefits but weak predictive power (IC=0.004). This suggests: (1) The regime filters are effective at risk management and portfolio construction, but (2) Without the core price-volume correlation signal, the factors lack directional predictive power. The hypothesis about 'identifying high-quality informed trading flows' requires the price-volume coordination component to be tested. The current implementation only tests regime adaptation and volume confirmation, which appear to work as risk/quality filters but not as standalone alpha signals. The increased max drawdown (-0.103) indicates the regime filters may be too aggressive or the volume concentration factor introduces unwanted volatility exposure.",

        "reason": "The previous hypothesis was over-engineered with three separate components and complex mathematical transformations (z-scores, logarithms, weighted combinations). The new hypothesis simplifies the approach: (1) Focus on the CORE signal: multi-horizon price-volume rank correlations (10D and 25D) that directly measure informed trading coordination without auxiliary filters. (2) Replace the complex volatility regime weighting (z-score transformation with scaling) with a simple threshold-based quality gate that only filters extreme volatility periods. (3) Remove the volume concentration confirmation factor entirely - it adds complexity without clear theoretical justification and may have contributed to the increased drawdown. (4) Use two complementary horizons (10D tactical, 25D strategic) instead of 15D/30D to better capture different trading time scales. (5) Combine the two horizons through simple averaging or rank-based aggregation rather than volatility-weighted schemes. This simplified approach: (a) Reduces parameter count and complexity, (b) Makes the factor more interpretable and robust, (c) Focuses on the core theoretical insight (price-volume coordination as informed trading proxy), (d) Uses a minimal quality filter to avoid noise without over-fitting to volatility regimes.

The improved IC and annualized return suggest the hypothesis has merit in capturing predictive signals, but the deteriorated risk metrics (max drawdown) indicate the factor combination may be capturing volatile regime shifts without adequate risk control. The three-factor combination successfully identifies tail risk and microstructure transitions, but the extreme drawdown suggests these signals may be too concentrated in high-volatility periods.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is PARTIALLY SUPPORTED. The combination of volume-weighted return skewness (20D), normalized range percentile (10D), and range volatility clustering (8D) demonstrates predictive power through improved IC and annualized returns, validating that tail risk repricing and microstructure transitions contain actionable information. However, the 50% worse max drawdown reveals a critical weakness: the current implementation may be over-sensitive to extreme regime shifts, leading to concentrated exposure during market stress periods. The hypothesis framework is sound, but the factor construction needs refinement to balance signal capture with risk management. Key issues: (1) The 20-day window for skewness may be too long, causing delayed reaction to regime changes; (2) The 10-day range percentile and 8-day volatility clustering use different lookback periods without clear justification, potentially creating temporal misalignment; (3) No dampening mechanism exists for extreme values that could drive the poor drawdown performance.",

The original 20-day skewness window was too slow to react to rapid market changes. (2) **Noise Reduction**: Replacing simple autocorrelation with exponentially-weighted volatility persistence reduces sensitivity to single-day outliers that likely contributed to the extreme drawdown. (3) **Risk Normalization**: Adding a denominator term that scales signals by recent volatility levels prevents over-concentration in high-volatility periods. This approach preserves the hypothesis's predictive edge (evidenced by superior IC and returns) while addressing the risk control weakness (poor max drawdown). The modifications are methodological refinements within the same theoretical framework rather than a directional change, focusing on robust factor construction through: shorter reaction windows, temporal alignment, noise smoothing, and volatility-adjusted scaling.

(2) A more nuanced skewness filter (e.g., using a sigmoid transformation or percentile ranking instead of simple MAX) can better differentiate between moderately favorable and highly favorable risk profiles, avoiding binary filtering that may discard useful information. (3) Volatility adjustment directly addresses the drawdown concern by reducing exposure to high-volatility momentum signals that are more prone to sharp reversals. (4) Parameter alignment (harmonizing windows to 20 days where possible) reduces the factor's complexity and potential overfitting while improving interpretability.

        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is strongly supported by the results. The composite factor's superior performance across IC, annualized return, and information ratio demonstrates that: (1) combining 40-day momentum persistence with price-volume correlation effectively identifies sustainable trends, (2) 20-day volume-weighted return skewness serves as an effective risk filter, and (3) the multiplicative combination of these components creates synergistic predictive power. The MAX(0, skewness) filter successfully screens for favorable asymmetric risk profiles. However, the slightly increased drawdown suggests that while the factor identifies strong upward trends, it may benefit from additional downside protection mechanisms. The individual components (Momentum_Persistence_VolumeCorr_40D and VolumeWeighted_Return_Skewness_20D) should be analyzed separately to understand their standalone contributions and potential for further optimization.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "The current factor's success validates the core concept, but the increased max drawdown indicates room for improvement in risk management. The new hypothesis focuses on three key refinements within the same theoretical framework: (1) Dual-timeframe momentum captures both tactical and strategic trend strength, reducing sensitivity to short-term reversals that may contribute to drawdowns. (2) A more nuanced skewness filter (e.g., using a sigmoid transformation or percentile ranking instead of simple MAX) can better differentiate between moderately favorable and highly favorable risk profiles, avoiding binary filtering that may discard useful information. (3) Volatility adjustment directly addresses the drawdown concern by reducing exposure to high-volatility momentum signals that are more prone to sharp reversals. (4) Parameter alignment (harmonizing windows to 20 days where possible) reduces the factor's complexity and potential overfitting while improving interpretability. These changes represent methodological iterations rather than directional shifts, allowing us to exhaust the potential of the momentum-skewness framework before considering alternative approaches."

        "hypothesis": "Hypothesis: A dual-confirmation mean reversion factor that combines volume-filtered 10-day price residuals standardized by sector-neutral rolling volatility with 15-day intraday range compression/expansion patterns will predict short-term returns, where signals are amplified when both extreme price deviations (top/bottom 30% of cross-sectional distribution) coincide with abnormal volatility regime shifts (measured by normalized high-low range clustering above 60th percentile), creating a three-layer validation system that captures high-conviction reversal opportunities with microstructure confirmation.\n                Concise Observation: Parent strategies show complementary strengths with Parent 1 achieving RankIC=0.0198 through volume-filtered price residuals and Parent 2 reaching RankIC=0.0299 via intraday volatility patterns, suggesting that combining price dislocation magnitude signals with volatility microstructure regime detection could create synergistic effects by adding multiple layers of confirmation that reduce false positives while capturing the temporal alignment between extreme price deviations and market microstructure transitions.\n                Concise Justification: The fusion is theoretically grounded in market microstructure theory where temporary price dislocations become more exploitable when accompanied by observable changes in intraday volatility patterns, as range compression/expansion signals shifting market regimes that facilitate mean reversion, while volume filtering ensures the reversals occur in liquid conditions where informed traders can act, creating a robust multi-dimensional signal that captures both the magnitude of mispricing and the microstructure conditions conducive to correction.\n                Concise Knowledge: When mean reversion signals derived from regression residuals are validated by both sufficient trading volume and concurrent intraday volatility regime transitions, the predictive power for short-term reversals increases substantially because the dual confirmation filters out noise-driven price movements and identifies genuine temporary mispricings that occur during microstructure regime changes, with the volatility clustering component acting as a catalyst indicator for imminent price corrections.\n                concise Specification: The factor combines three components with specific parameters: (1) 10-day linear regression residuals of close prices against sector-neutral returns, standardized by 20-day rolling volatility, filtered for above-median volume; (2) 15-day normalized intraday range metric calculated as (high-low)/close with 8-day clustering intensity measured by standard deviation; (3) interaction term activating when price residuals exceed 30th/70th percentile thresholds AND range clustering surpasses 60th percentile, with final factor values weighted by the product of residual extremity and volatility regime intensity, tested on daily frequency data with cross-sectional ranking applied.\n                ",

        "observations": "The current experiment demonstrates strong performance improvements in key metrics. The annualized return increased from 0.052010 to 0.066716 (+28.3%), and the information ratio improved from 0.972561 to 1.035510 (+6.5%). However, the max drawdown deteriorated from -0.072585 to -0.088750 (-22.3%), and IC decreased slightly from 0.005798 to 0.004925 (-15.1%). The dual-confirmation approach shows promise in capturing profitable mean reversion opportunities, though with increased downside risk and slightly weaker predictive correlation.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is PARTIALLY SUPPORTED. The dual-confirmation mechanism successfully identifies profitable reversal opportunities, as evidenced by the substantial improvement in annualized returns and information ratio. The combination of volume-filtered price residuals with intraday range volatility clustering does create actionable signals. However, the increased max drawdown suggests the three-layer validation system may be too aggressive in signal generation, potentially capturing false positives during extreme market conditions. The lower IC indicates that while the factor generates profitable trades, the linear correlation between predictions and actual returns is weaker, suggesting the relationship may be non-linear or that the factor captures tail events rather than consistent directional predictions. The volume filter and dual-confirmation structure appear effective, but the current parameter choices (10-day residuals, 8-day volatility STD, 20-day normalization) may need refinement to balance return generation with risk control.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "The current factor's strong returns but weaker IC and higher drawdown suggest overfitting to specific market regimes. The new hypothesis addresses this through: (1) SIMPLIFICATION - Reducing the three-layer validation to a cleaner two-signal interaction, eliminating the complex percentile-based thresholding that may cause overfitting. (2) PARAMETER ADJUSTMENT - Extending the price residual window from 10 to 12 days and volatility normalization from 20 to 15 days to better align time horizons and reduce parameter count. (3) SIGNAL CLARITY - Replacing volatility 'clustering' (8-day STD of normalized range) with direct 10-day range momentum (change in normalized range), which is more interpretable and less prone to regime-specific patterns. (4) VOLUME CONSISTENCY - Changing from single-day volume filter to 3-day sustained volume requirement to reduce noise from sporadic volume spikes. (5) INTERACTION STRUCTURE - Maintaining the multiplicative rank-based interaction but with simpler components, reducing the total number of nested operations. This approach preserves the successful dual-confirmation concept while addressing the complexity issues that likely caused the higher drawdown and lower IC."
