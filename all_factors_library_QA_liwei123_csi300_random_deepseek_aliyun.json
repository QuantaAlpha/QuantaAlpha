The complexity of the factors—particularly 'Intraday_Range_Volume_Mismatch_15D' with its cross-sectional ranking and multiple operations—likely contributed to the failure.

Simpler factors—using basic operations like z-scores, correlations, or normalized differences—are more likely to be computed correctly and generalize better. For example, a factor like 'Volume_Zscore_10D' (TS_ZSCORE(volume, 10)) could capture abnormal volume attention, while 'Price_Stability_10D' (1 / (TS_STD(DELTA(close, 1), 10) + 1e-8)) could proxy fundamental stability.

These simplifications align with the core hypothesis—persistent order flow imbalances create distortions—while being easier to compute and less prone to implementation issues.

The mathematical formulations for the individual factors (Trend_Stability_R2_20D, Liquidity_Distortion_VWAP_Imbalance_5D) and their composite (Composite_Trend_Liquidity_Factor_20D_5D) appear logically sound on paper, assuming the underlying functions (TS_VAR, REGBETA, TS_SUM, etc.) are correctly implemented and the data is properly accessed.",

The composite factor's formulation is complex (high Symbol Length risk). Before attempting the full interaction, we should first verify the individual components work correctly. A new, simpler implementation strategy is proposed: 1) Fix the code to ensure basic factor calculation runs without errors. 2) Start by testing the two base factors (Trend R2 and VWAP Imbalance) independently to ensure they produce valid, non-empty outputs. 3) Then, create a much simpler composite factor. Instead of the complex multiplicative formula, use a basic linear combination or interaction term (e.g., R2 * VWAP_Imbalance) to reduce complexity and potential overfitting. This stepwise approach isolates implementation issues and allows us to build complexity only after verifying the foundational pieces. The primary goal for the next iteration is to get a working factor that produces a non-empty DataFrame."

The new hypothesis maintains the core idea (volatility + liquidity interaction affecting momentum) but uses simpler, more direct measures: 1) Basic volatility measure (standard deviation of returns), 2) Basic liquidity measure (volume or price range), 3) Simple multiplicative interaction. This approach reduces complexity, avoids potential calculation errors, and focuses on testing the fundamental relationship before adding sophisticated statistical measures like GARCH persistence or Herfindahl indices."

It expects a positive relationship where the composite signal (regime indicator * [momentum + trend-flow interaction]) predicts higher future returns.

All three factors share common issues: they rely on daily returns ($return) which are not available in the source data (daily_pv.h5), and they use complex mathematical operations without proper data validation. The Momentum_Trend_Stability_15D_10D factor has particularly concerning complexity with SIGN, INV, and epsilon operations that would likely cause numerical instability. The Volatility_Regime_Enhanced_Momentum_14D_8D factor introduces cross-sectional ZSCORE operations that require careful handling of missing data. The complete lack of results suggests fundamental data access or calculation errors that prevented any factor values from being generated.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis cannot be evaluated with the current results. The core issue is that all factors depend on daily returns which must be calculated from available price data ($close, $open). Without this preprocessing step, the factors cannot be computed. Additionally, the factors contain complex mathematical transformations that may introduce numerical errors or excessive noise. The hypothesis about medium-term momentum within stable trend regimes combined with overreaction divergence remains theoretically sound but requires proper implementation with available data.",

        "reason": "The new hypothesis simplifies the original concept by: 1) Using price-based momentum instead of return-based momentum (since returns must be calculated), 2) Focusing on volatility stability rather than complex trend regime identification, 3) Emphasizing the divergence between medium-term and short-term performance as a cleaner signal. This approach reduces complexity while maintaining the core idea of momentum persistence in favorable conditions. The factors should be implemented with basic arithmetic operations using available price data, avoiding complex transformations that caused implementation failures."

The hypothesis needs to be tested with radically simpler formulations: 1) Replace TS_STD with simple price range calculations, 2) Use basic volume-price ratios instead of regression coefficients, 3) Eliminate small constants (1e-8) that create numerical instability, 4) Reduce window sizes to 3-10 days for more responsive signals.

Without any valid factor values, we cannot assess whether the behavioral bias hypothesis has predictive power or compare it to SOTA results.",

The new hypothesis maintains the core behavioral bias concept but simplifies implementation to: 1) Calculate returns from close prices, 2) Create simple attention competition metrics using volatility ratios, 3) Use volume-price correlation as institutional proxy, 4) Ensure all calculations produce valid numerical outputs. This addresses the implementation failure while preserving the theoretical framework."

The hypothesis cannot be evaluated since no performance metrics are available. This is a severe implementation failure that must be addressed before any hypothesis testing can occur.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis remains untested due to implementation failure. The proposed factors—Microstructure_Fundamental_Convergence_8D, Volatility_Transition_Convergence_10D, and MultiTimeframe_Reversal_Signal_15D—are conceptually aligned with the hypothesis, aiming to capture convergence of microstructure inefficiency, fundamental deterioration, and volatility transitions. However, their formulations exhibit significant issues: 1) They misuse RANK without clear cross-sectional ranking logic in a time-series calculation. 2) They lack explicit proxies for bid-ask volume ratios, profitability decline, or market overreaction (e.g., using close-open as a proxy for order flow is weak). 3) The volatility transition factor uses DELTA(TS_STD(close,10),5) which is ambiguous (likely intended as TS_STD(close,10) - TS_STD(close,10).shift(5)). 4) The MultiTimeframe factor uses correlation between normalized volume and 15-day mean close, which may not capture fundamental deterioration. These factors are overly complex and likely non-implementable as written.",

The original factors were overly complex, mixing cross-sectional ranking (RANK) with time-series operations, which is computationally problematic and often leads to implementation errors. The new hypothesis focuses on core, interpretable components: volume anomaly (e.g., volume / TS_MEAN(volume, window)), price momentum (e.g., returns over a window), and volatility change (e.g., TS_STD(returns, window)). By avoiding nested functions and ambiguous operations like DELTA and RANK in time-series, factors become easier to implement, less prone to overfitting, and more likely to generate valid outputs. This aligns with the critical complexity control requirement—targeting symbol length <150 characters and using 2-4 core features. For example, a factor like (volume / TS_MEAN(volume, 10)) * (close / TS_MEAN(close, 10) - 1) * (TS_STD(returns, 10) / TS_STD(returns, 20)) captures volume spike, price deviation, and volatility increase simply."

This suggests that both implemented factors (Sentiment_Regime_Ownership_Interaction_15D and Structural_Stability_Alpha_10D) encountered critical implementation errors during execution. The absence of results prevents any meaningful analysis of hypothesis support or comparison with SOTA. The most likely causes are: 1) Missing required data variables in the source dataset, 2) Mathematical formulation errors leading to computational failures, or 3) Implementation code that doesn't match the provided factor definitions. Both factors rely on variables like 'return' which may not be directly available in the daily_pv.h5 dataset and need to be calculated from price data. Additionally, the factor formulations contain complex nested functions that could produce invalid operations (e.g., division by zero, correlation with insufficient data points).",

However, examining the factor formulations reveals a disconnect between the hypothesis concepts and the actual mathematical implementations.

This suggests either: 1) The factor descriptions don't match the mathematical formulations, or 2) The hypothesis needs to be reformulated to focus on price/volume patterns rather than ownership/governance structures.

However, the factor formulations suggest an alternative direction: using price-volume correlation as a proxy for 'ownership stability' (since institutional activity often shows in volume patterns) and return volatility as a proxy for 'sentiment shifts'. The failed factors attempted to combine these elements but were overly complex. A simpler, more direct approach would be to create factors that: 1) Measure the stability of price-volume relationships, 2) Normalize by volatility to account for different market regimes, and 3) Incorporate momentum to capture direction. This maintains the core idea of 'structural stability' but uses available data. The new hypothesis focuses on measurable technical patterns rather than unobservable ownership/governance characteristics."

Specifically, the '$return' variable is referenced in all factors but doesn't appear to exist in the daily_pv.h5 file based on the provided schema (which only shows $open, $close, $high, $low, $volume, $factor).

When medium-term momentum experiences short-term reversals during low-volatility periods, it often represents a consolidation before a continuation; if these reversals coincide with abnormal attention signals (e.g., volume-price divergence), they are more likely to be meaningful rather than noise.\n                concise Specification: The hypothesis scope includes stocks with: 1) systematic changes in efficiency proxies (e.g., 5-10 day adjusted returns or price-volume convergence), 2) medium-term momentum (e.g., 30-50 day) showing short-term reversals (e.g., 5-10 day), 3) occurring during low-volatility consolidation (e.g., volatility below a rolling percentile), and 4) confirmed by abnormal attention signals (e.g., volume-price range mismatches).

        "reason": "The implementation failures suggest the original hypothesis was too complex to operationalize effectively. Financial factors with excessive nesting, multiple timeframes, and conditional branches often fail in practice due to data requirements, computational stability, and overfitting. A simpler approach would: 1) Reduce factor complexity to single core relationships; 2) Use fewer time windows and parameters; 3) Avoid cross-sectional transformations that depend on daily universe composition; 4) Focus on economically intuitive signals rather than mathematical combinations. For example, 'momentum during low volatility periods' could be tested as a simple interaction term rather than a complex convergence strategy. This simplification should improve implementation reliability and reduce overfitting risk while still capturing the core insight about volatility regimes affecting momentum persistence."
