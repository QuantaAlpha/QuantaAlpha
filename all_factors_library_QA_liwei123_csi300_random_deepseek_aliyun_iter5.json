The third factor (EER_5D) is overly complex with multiple divisions, ranking, and cross-sectional operations. I propose simpler alternatives: 1) Use a basic volatility ratio factor: (high-low)/std(close,10), and 2) Use a simple volume exhaustion factor: (price_return * volume_return) where both are measured over 5 days. This reduces complexity while maintaining the core hypothesis elements."

The most likely cause is that the required base data columns (e.g., $return, $high, $low, $close, $volume) are not present in the provided 'daily_pv.h5' file. The README lists these columns, but the actual file structure might differ, or the data might contain missing values that prevent calculation.

The core idea—combining information processing inefficiency with microstructure anomalies—is theoretically sound and worth pursuing. However, the current approach failed at the data extraction/calculation stage. Before refining the hypothesis, we must ensure the basic factor calculations work. The factors themselves appear reasonable: PriceReactionConsistency_10D uses a 10-day correlation, OrderFlowImbalance_5D uses a 5-day window for mean/std, and VolatilityConvergence_8D uses nested 3-day and 8-day windows. Their formulations are clear and not overly complex (symbol lengths are moderate). The issue is likely data availability or a mismatch between expected and actual column names.",

The new hypothesis is essentially the same, but with a focus on ensuring the factors are calculable. Steps: 1) Inspect the actual columns in 'daily_pv.h5' to confirm $return exists (it may need to be computed from $close). 2) Implement each factor separately with robust error handling for missing data. 3) Use simple, static hyperparameters (10-day, 5-day, 8-day windows as given). 4) After successful calculation, combine them (e.g., via multiplication or weighted sum) to test the joint effect.
