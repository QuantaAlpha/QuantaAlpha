This suggests that while the factor has stronger linear correlation with future returns, it does not translate into superior risk-adjusted performance or capital efficiency. The hypothesis combines three intuitive signals—long-term reversal, negative price-volume correlation, and low volume volatility—which are individually sound, but their additive combination may introduce noise or overfitting. The current formulation uses multiple logarithmic transformations, rank normalizations, and inverse volatility scaling, which increases complexity. Although no explicit complexity warnings were provided, the use of three distinct nonlinear transformations and rank operations across multiple horizons (60-day price change, 20-day correlation, 5-day volatility) suggests potential over-engineering.

The additive rank summation in Composite_Reversal_Signal_Factor may be suboptimal, as it equally weights three signals with potentially different regimes and variances.

The current additive form may activate the signal too frequently, including in weak regimes. By restructuring the combination as a product of ranked components—especially using the negative correlation as a modulating term—we can enhance signal specificity. Additionally, we recommend reducing the number of free parameters and transformations: for example, replacing the inverse log-volume volatility with a rank-based z-score over a slightly longer window (e.g., 10 days) to improve stability.

        "observations": "The combined factor shows mixed performance compared to the SOTA result. While the IC (Information Coefficient) improves from 0.005798 to 0.008547, indicating better predictive power of the factor, the annualized return (0.045264) remains below the SOTA (0.052010), and both the information ratio (0.655586 vs 0.972561) and max drawdown (-0.097520 vs -0.072585) are worse. This suggests that while the factor has stronger linear correlation with future returns, it does not translate into superior risk-adjusted performance or capital efficiency. The hypothesis combines three intuitive signals—long-term reversal, negative price-volume correlation, and low volume volatility—which are individually sound, but their additive combination may introduce noise or overfitting. The current formulation uses multiple logarithmic transformations, rank normalizations, and inverse volatility scaling, which increases complexity. Although no explicit complexity warnings were provided, the use of three distinct nonlinear transformations and rank operations across multiple horizons (60-day price change, 20-day correlation, 5-day volatility) suggests potential over-engineering. The factor may benefit from simplification and parameter sensitivity analysis.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is partially supported: the IC improvement confirms that the combination of long-term reversal, short-term negative price-volume correlation, and low volume volatility contains predictive signal. However, the deterioration in risk-adjusted returns and drawdown indicates that the current implementation does not effectively translate this signal into robust portfolio performance. The additive rank summation in Composite_Reversal_Signal_Factor may be suboptimal, as it equally weights three signals with potentially different regimes and variances. The Long_Term_Reversal_Short_Volume_Calm_Factor uses a multiplicative form, which could better capture interaction effects, but its performance is not isolated in the results. Future work should compare different combination methods (multiplicative vs additive vs z-score stacking) and evaluate their stability.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "Multiplicative interactions naturally capture conditional logic (e.g., only strong when all conditions are met), which aligns with the economic intuition of the hypothesis: a reversal is more likely when a prolonged decline is met with declining selling pressure (negative price-volume correlation) and stabilizing volume (low volatility). The current additive form may activate the signal too frequently, including in weak regimes. By restructuring the combination as a product of ranked components—especially using the negative correlation as a modulating term—we can enhance signal specificity. Additionally, we recommend reducing the number of free parameters and transformations: for example, replacing the inverse log-volume volatility with a rank-based z-score over a slightly longer window (e.g., 10 days) to improve stability. We also suggest testing whether the 60-day price change can be replaced with a 40- to 50-day window to avoid overfitting to an arbitrary horizon."

        "observations": "The current combined result includes two implemented factors: KLEN_Intraday_Volatility and WVMA5_Volume_Weighted_Volatility, while the third factor, RSQR10_Trend_Stability, was not implemented. The resulting performance shows a modest annualized return of 0.0679 and an information ratio of 1.036, which are reasonable but not outstanding. The IC value is very low at 0.00478, suggesting weak predictive power of the combined signal. The max drawdown is relatively controlled at -0.1029. However, the absence of the RSQR10 factor—central to the hypothesis—severely limits the validity of testing the full hypothesis, which relies on the integration of trend stability, intraday range, and volume-weighted volatility.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The current result neither fully supports nor refutes the target hypothesis, because a core component (RSQR10) was not implemented. The hypothesis posits that the *complete integration* of all three signals is necessary, but this experiment only evaluates a partial combination (KLEN and WVMA5). Therefore, the observed performance may not reflect the true potential of the hypothesized interaction. The low IC further suggests that the current two-factor system lacks strong return predictability, possibly due to missing the trend persistence signal.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "Trend stability (RSQR10) acts as a regime filter that distinguishes meaningful trends from noise. Without it, KLEN and WVMA5 may capture volatility and spread dynamics in both trending and mean-reverting markets, diluting their predictive power. The low IC in the current result supports this: volatility and range signals alone may lack directional consistency. Adding RSQR10 could improve signal coherence by focusing on high-persistence periods where volume-backed volatility and intraday ranges are more informative. This refined hypothesis isolates the incremental value of trend stability while preserving the original framework."

        "observations": "The combined results show mixed performance relative to the SOTA. While the max drawdown is significantly worse (-0.151 vs -0.0726), the other key metrics—information ratio (0.655 vs 0.973), annualized return (0.0481 vs 0.0520), and IC (0.00521 vs 0.00580)—are all lower than SOTA, indicating weaker predictive power and risk-adjusted performance. None of the implemented factors outperform SOTA on any major metric. However, the hypothesis emphasizes simplicity and reduced transformations to improve generalization, which may not be fully reflected in these metrics alone. The factors avoid redundant ranking and z-scoring, aligning with the theoretical framework, but their underperformance suggests either insufficient signal strength or suboptimal parameterization.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The current results do not support the hypothesis that a simplified multiplicative reversal factor will outperform SOTA in information ratio and annualized return. In fact, all evaluated metrics are worse than SOTA, suggesting that the simplification may have removed necessary normalization or scaling that contributes to robustness. However, the hypothesis remains theoretically sound—overfitting from excessive transformations is a real concern in quantitative finance—and the failure may stem from implementation choices rather than the core idea. The use of raw ratios and untransformed volatility could benefit from mild standardization (e.g., time-series z-score with rolling window) without reintroducing cross-sectional ranks.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The original hypothesis correctly identifies over-processing (e.g., stacked z-scores, redundant ranks) as a source of overfitting. However, completely removing all normalization may discard important variance stabilization needed for reliable signal generation. Applying time-series (i.e., within-instrument) z-scoring to each component—such as the 45-day price ratio, the 20-day log price-volume correlation, and the inverse volume volatility—can preserve stationarity without introducing look-ahead or cross-sectional dependencies. This balances simplicity with statistical robustness. Additionally, the current formulation uses an unbounded raw price ratio and may be sensitive to scale differences across instruments. Reintroducing mild, localized normalization aligns with the spirit of the hypothesis while addressing empirical weaknesses."

The only metric where performance deteriorates is max drawdown (-0.142 vs -0.073), indicating larger peak-to-trough losses. However, the significant gains in risk-adjusted return (information ratio) and absolute return suggest the trade-off may be acceptable. All three component factors are successfully implemented and follow a consistent design philosophy: time-series z-scoring, multiplicative combination, and avoidance of cross-sectional ranking. The factors use moderate window sizes (10D, 20D, 45D), which are reasonable and not overly complex. No explicit complexity warnings were raised, but the multiplicative combination of three non-trivial z-scored components could still risk overfitting if not carefully validated out-of-sample.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results strongly support the core hypothesis that time-series z-score normalization of multiplicative reversal components—without cross-sectional ranking—can enhance signal stability and predictive power. The consistent use of within-instrument normalization across all three components appears to preserve signal integrity while avoiding cross-sectional leakage. The improvement in information ratio and annualized return validates the theoretical advantage of this approach. However, the deterioration in max drawdown suggests that while the signal is stronger on average, it may also amplify downside risk during certain regimes, possibly due to over-reliance on the multiplicative structure amplifying noise when one component gives false signals.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "The current factor achieves superior return and risk-adjusted performance but at the cost of deeper drawdowns. This suggests that the multiplicative structure, while effective in amplifying strong reversal signals, may also overreact when components co-move during market stress. By introducing bounded combination rules—such as clipping z-scores at ±3 or using a hyperbolic tangent transformation—we can preserve the benefits of multiplicative interaction while improving robustness. This refinement maintains the core hypothesis of within-instrument normalization and signal stability but adds a control mechanism to prevent extreme signal values. This direction explores the trade-off between signal strength and stability without abandoning the theoretical framework."

        "observations": "The current hypothesis proposes that replacing hard z-score clipping with smooth, adaptive saturation functions (e.g., tanh) in multiplicative reversal factors will reduce maximum drawdown while preserving predictive signal, leading to improved risk-adjusted returns. The two implemented factors—Soft_Saturation_Reversal_Factor_45D_V2 and Adaptive_Volume_Volatility_Saturation_Factor_20D—both adopt tanh-based soft saturation across three components: long-term price reversal, negative short-term price-volume correlation, and low volume volatility (measured via log-volume standard deviation or MAD). The results show a modest improvement in maximum drawdown (from -0.142422 to -0.129308), indicating that the soft saturation successfully reduced tail risk during volatile regimes. However, all other key performance metrics—information ratio (0.794 vs 1.084), annualized return (0.0593 vs 0.0864), and IC (0.0056 vs 0.0071)—are meaningfully worse than the SOTA. This suggests that while the soft saturation achieves its goal of drawdown control, it may be overly compressing predictive signals, especially in moderate-to-strong regimes where tanh’s asymptotic behavior attenuates useful information. Both factors use similar structures and hyperparameters: 45-day price reversal window, 20-day correlation window, and 10-day volatility estimation window. The second factor replaces TS_STD with TS_MAD for robustness but does not yield a noticeable improvement, suggesting that the choice of dispersion measure is less impactful than the overall compression effect of tanh. Neither factor shows explicit complexity warnings, but both have high structural complexity (multiple conditional branches, nested transformations, and three interacting nonlinear components), which increases the risk of overfitting despite good drawdown performance.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is partially supported: soft saturation via tanh does reduce maximum drawdown, confirming its effectiveness in controlling tail risk. However, the degradation in information ratio, annualized return, and IC indicates that the current implementation sacrifices too much predictive power. The tanh function’s rapid saturation (near ±3) may be compressing not only outliers but also moderately strong signals that could contribute to alpha. The hypothesis remains valid in principle, but the current realization appears suboptimal. Future versions should explore less aggressive saturation functions or adaptive scaling of the tanh input to preserve more signal in the mid-range.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current tanh-based saturation is static and agnostic to regime shifts. During low-volatility periods, even moderate z-scores may be unnecessarily compressed, reducing factor efficacy. By making the saturation function adaptive—e.g., adjusting the tanh slope (i.e., tanh(α × x) where α is inversely related to market-wide volatility—we can maintain sensitivity in calm markets while enhancing robustness during turbulence. This preserves the core idea of smooth saturation but introduces regime-awareness, potentially improving the trade-off between drawdown reduction and signal retention. Additionally, simplifying the factor structure—e.g., removing the conditional branch on price-volume correlation and instead using a continuous transformation—could reduce complexity and improve generalization. Using fewer base features and avoiding deeply nested expressions will help mitigate overfitting risks while maintaining interpretability."

        "observations": "The current hypothesis proposes that replacing hard z-score clipping with smooth, adaptive saturation functions (e.g., tanh) in multiplicative reversal factors will reduce maximum drawdown while preserving predictive signal, leading to improved risk-adjusted returns. The two implemented factors—Soft_Saturation_Reversal_Factor_45D_V2 and Adaptive_Volume_Volatility_Saturation_Factor_20D—both adopt tanh-based soft saturation across three components: long-term price reversal, negative short-term price-volume correlation, and low volume volatility (measured via log-volume standard deviation or MAD). The results show a modest improvement in maximum drawdown (from -0.142422 to -0.129308), indicating that the soft saturation successfully reduced tail risk during volatile regimes. However, all other key performance metrics—information ratio (0.794 vs 1.084), annualized return (0.0593 vs 0.0864), and IC (0.0056 vs 0.0071)—are meaningfully worse than the SOTA. This suggests that while the soft saturation achieves its goal of drawdown control, it may be overly compressing predictive signals, especially in moderate-to-strong regimes where tanh’s asymptotic behavior attenuates useful information. Both factors use similar structures and hyperparameters: 45-day price reversal window, 20-day correlation window, and 10-day volatility estimation window. The second factor replaces TS_STD with TS_MAD for robustness but does not yield a noticeable improvement, suggesting that the choice of dispersion measure is less impactful than the overall compression effect of tanh. Neither factor shows explicit complexity warnings, but both have high structural complexity (multiple conditional branches, nested transformations, and three interacting nonlinear components), which increases the risk of overfitting despite good drawdown performance.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is partially supported: soft saturation via tanh does reduce maximum drawdown, confirming its effectiveness in controlling tail risk. However, the degradation in information ratio, annualized return, and IC indicates that the current implementation sacrifices too much predictive power. The tanh function’s rapid saturation (near ±3) may be compressing not only outliers but also moderately strong signals that could contribute to alpha. The hypothesis remains valid in principle, but the current realization appears suboptimal. Future versions should explore less aggressive saturation functions or adaptive scaling of the tanh input to preserve more signal in the mid-range.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current tanh-based saturation is static and agnostic to regime shifts. During low-volatility periods, even moderate z-scores may be unnecessarily compressed, reducing factor efficacy. By making the saturation function adaptive—e.g., adjusting the tanh slope (i.e., tanh(α × x) where α is inversely related to market-wide volatility—we can maintain sensitivity in calm markets while enhancing robustness during turbulence. This preserves the core idea of smooth saturation but introduces regime-awareness, potentially improving the trade-off between drawdown reduction and signal retention. Additionally, simplifying the factor structure—e.g., removing the conditional branch on price-volume correlation and instead using a continuous transformation—could reduce complexity and improve generalization. Using fewer base features and avoiding deeply nested expressions will help mitigate overfitting risks while maintaining interpretability."

The max drawdown of -0.1028 is acceptable but not exceptional. Both implemented factors—Regime_Adaptive_WVMA_Scaled_5D and Dynamic_RSQR_Weighted_by_KLEN_5D—follow a clean regime-switching logic based on KLEN quantiles (using a 20-day lookback and 0.7 quantile threshold), which introduces adaptability without excessive complexity. No complexity warnings were issued, indicating that both factors are reasonably concise in formulation, use a limited number of base features (primarily $close, $volume, $high, $low), and have minimal free parameters (only scalar multipliers like 0.5 and 0.7).

For example, instead of applying fixed multipliers (1.5 or 0.3), the weight on WVMA could be defined as σ(α(KLEN − median(KLEN))), where σ is the sigmoid function. This retains the core idea of KLEN-modulated sensitivity but enhances it with smoother dynamics.

        "observations": "The combined factor achieves an annualized return of 0.0836 and an Information Ratio of 1.21, which are reasonably strong, but the IC of 0.006428 falls short of the target threshold of 0.01. This suggests that while the strategy generates positive risk-adjusted returns, the predictive power of the factor combination is not sufficiently strong to meet the hypothesis bar. The max drawdown of -0.1028 is acceptable but not exceptional. Both implemented factors—Regime_Adaptive_WVMA_Scaled_5D and Dynamic_RSQR_Weighted_by_KLEN_5D—follow a clean regime-switching logic based on KLEN quantiles (using a 20-day lookback and 0.7 quantile threshold), which introduces adaptability without excessive complexity. No complexity warnings were issued, indicating that both factors are reasonably concise in formulation, use a limited number of base features (primarily $close, $volume, $high, $low), and have minimal free parameters (only scalar multipliers like 0.5 and 0.7). However, the binary regime switch (using indicator functions) may be too rigid, potentially limiting smooth adaptability to transitional market states.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The current result partially supports the hypothesis by demonstrating that regime-conditioned weighting of volatility and trend stability signals can yield positive performance. However, it does not fully validate the hypothesis since the IC remains below 0.01. The design logic—amplifying WVMA in high-KLEN regimes and preserving RSQR in low-KLEN regimes—is sound, but the binary switching mechanism may hinder fine-grained responsiveness. Additionally, the 20-day quantile lookback and 0.7 threshold appear reasonable but could benefit from sensitivity analysis.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "The current binary indicator function (1_{KLEN > Q_{0.7}}) creates a sharp, discontinuous shift in factor weights, which may introduce instability or missed opportunities during moderate volatility periods. A continuous weighting scheme—such as a logistic function of KLEN relative to its rolling quantiles—would allow gradual transitions between regimes, improving robustness. For example, instead of applying fixed multipliers (1.5 or 0.3), the weight on WVMA could be defined as σ(α(KLEN − median(KLEN))), where σ is the sigmoid function. This retains the core idea of KLEN-modulated sensitivity but enhances it with smoother dynamics. Given that the current factors are not overly complex, this refinement can be implemented without increasing symbol length or base feature count significantly, preserving generalization potential."

Furthermore, the current formulation introduces multiple sources of complexity: three distinct base signals (reversal, volume correlation, volume stability), each with its own nonlinear processing and conditional logic.

Notably, the max drawdown is worse, indicating increased downside risk. Despite the theoretical appeal of quantile-based adaptive gain for volatility regime modulation, the current formulation does not translate into improved performance. All three implemented factors follow a similar structural pattern—tanh transformation with a piecewise adaptive gain based on market volatility quantiles—suggesting potential over-engineering with multiple nonlinearities and conditional thresholds. While the hypothesis aims to improve signal-to-noise trade-off, the results suggest the added complexity may be degrading generalization, possibly due to regime-switching instability or overfitting to historical volatility thresholds.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The current results refute the hypothesis that replacing fixed scalar gains with quantile-based adaptive gains in tanh-transformed signals improves performance. The expected benefits—higher returns, better risk-adjusted performance, and controlled drawdowns—are not realized. The adaptive gain mechanism, while theoretically sound, may be too sensitive to cross-sectional volatility estimation and quantile thresholds, leading to unstable regime classification. Additionally, the use of multiple nonlinear transformations (tanh, z-score, correlation, MAD) combined with conditional scaling increases complexity without commensurate gains.",

        "reason": "The current factors use discontinuous, piecewise-constant gains (2.0, 1.0, 0.5) based on hard thresholds at Q0.2 and Q0.8, which can cause abrupt regime shifts and instability. Replacing this with a smooth, continuous gain function (e.g., sigmoidal or linear interpolation based on volatility percentile) would reduce sensitivity to threshold noise. Furthermore, the current formulation introduces multiple sources of complexity: three distinct base signals (reversal, volume correlation, volume stability), each with its own nonlinear processing and conditional logic. A unified, simpler signal with continuous adaptation is more likely to generalize. This new hypothesis retains the core idea of volatility-dependent signal modulation but implements it in a more robust and differentiable manner, reducing overfitting risk."

        "observations": "The hypothesis proposes that replacing median/IQR-based normalization with an exponentially weighted Z-score of KLEN in a sigmoid-weighted momentum factor will improve responsiveness to volatility regimes and achieve an IC > 0.01. The implemented factor, Adaptive_Momentum_Volatility_Regime_5D, achieves an IC of 0.006889, which is slightly above the SOTA IC of 0.006428, marking a small improvement in predictive correlation. However, the target threshold of IC > 0.01 is not met. While the annualized return (0.0363) and information ratio (0.4297) are below SOTA levels (0.0836 and 1.2107), the max drawdown is significantly worse (-0.1441 vs -0.1028), indicating higher risk and potential instability in performance. Despite the slight IC gain, the overall risk-adjusted performance deteriorates notably.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The current results partially support the hypothesis in that the use of exponentially weighted Z-score normalization improves IC slightly over the previous SOTA, suggesting enhanced signal relevance. However, the improvement is marginal and falls short of the stated goal (IC > 0.01). More critically, the deterioration in risk-adjusted metrics (information ratio) and increased drawdowns indicates that the adaptive weighting, while potentially more responsive, may also amplify noise during volatile transitions, reducing robustness. The formulation uses a sigmoid transformation with a fixed gain of 2, which may be too aggressive or insufficiently tuned. Additionally, the 5-day momentum horizon may be too short to benefit meaningfully from the adaptive volatility scaling.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current approach applies a static 5-day momentum scaled by a volatility-sensitive weight, which may over-amplify short-term noise when volatility spikes. A more robust approach would allow the effective momentum horizon to contract or expand based on volatility, mimicking adaptive filtering. By using the EW Z-score of KLEN to interpolate between short and long momentum (e.g., low Z-score → longer lookback, high Z-score → shorter lookback), the factor can maintain sensitivity during transitional regimes without sacrificing stability. This preserves the core idea of volatility-adaptive signal processing but implements it through structural adaptivity rather than simple amplitude scaling, which is more likely to generalize."

The results show that the current implementation achieves an IC of 0.009112, surpassing the SOTA IC of 0.006428, indicating stronger predictive power. The annualized return (0.085934) also exceeds the SOTA (0.083620), which is a meaningful improvement. However, the information ratio (0.996) is lower than SOTA (1.211), suggesting higher volatility or noise in the returns. The max drawdown is worse than SOTA (-0.108961 vs -0.102837), indicating greater risk exposure during downturns. Despite improved return and IC, the deterioration in risk-adjusted performance raises concerns about overfitting or instability in regime transitions.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is partially supported: the dynamic interpolation mechanism based on KLEN's EW Z-score does enhance predictive correlation (IC) and annualized return, validating the core idea of volatility-adaptive lookback windows. However, the decline in information ratio and max drawdown suggests that the current implementation may be too sensitive to short-term volatility fluctuations, leading to suboptimal regime switching or overreaction in high-KLEN periods. The use of a fixed sigmoid gain (multiplier of 2) and exponential weighting without explicit decay control may contribute to instability. Additionally, the factor combines multiple nonlinear transformations (Z-score, sigmoid, log returns, interpolation), increasing complexity and potential for overfitting.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "The current model uses a sigmoid function with a fixed gain (2×Z-score) to create a highly nonlinear transition between short and long momentum. While this enables smooth interpolation, it may amplify noise near the inflection point and cause abrupt shifts when Z-score crosses thresholds. A linear scaling of the Z-score (e.g., clipped between 0 and 1) could provide sufficient adaptivity with better stability. Removing the sigmoid and logarithmic transformations reduces symbolic complexity and free parameters, aligning with the principle of simplicity. This change maintains the core idea—volatility-driven lookback adaptation—but with improved robustness. Additionally, the current factor uses multiple base features ($high, $low, $close) and several derived functions (Z-score, sigmoid, log return), which increases ER and SL. Simplifying the expression will reduce overfitting risk and improve generalization."

        "observations": "The hypothesis proposes a dynamic interpolation between short-term (5-day) and long-term (20-day) momentum signals using a sigmoid-weighted function of the exponentially weighted Z-score of KLEN (intraday range normalized by close). The implemented factors—Dynamic_Window_Momentum_SigmoidKLEN_5_20D, KLEN_EW_ZScore_Sigmoid_Weight_10D, and Adaptive_Return_5_to_20D_Interpolation_by_KLEN_ZScore—are all successfully constructed and tested. The results show that the current implementation achieves an IC of 0.009112, surpassing the SOTA IC of 0.006428, indicating stronger predictive power. The annualized return (0.085934) also exceeds the SOTA (0.083620), which is a meaningful improvement. However, the information ratio (0.996) is lower than SOTA (1.211), suggesting higher volatility or noise in the returns. The max drawdown is worse than SOTA (-0.108961 vs -0.102837), indicating greater risk exposure during downturns. Despite improved return and IC, the deterioration in risk-adjusted performance raises concerns about overfitting or instability in regime transitions.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is partially supported: the dynamic interpolation mechanism based on KLEN's EW Z-score does enhance predictive correlation (IC) and annualized return, validating the core idea of volatility-adaptive lookback windows. However, the decline in information ratio and max drawdown suggests that the current implementation may be too sensitive to short-term volatility fluctuations, leading to suboptimal regime switching or overreaction in high-KLEN periods. The use of a fixed sigmoid gain (multiplier of 2) and exponential weighting without explicit decay control may contribute to instability. Additionally, the factor combines multiple nonlinear transformations (Z-score, sigmoid, log returns, interpolation), increasing complexity and potential for overfitting.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "The current model uses a sigmoid function with a fixed gain (2×Z-score) to create a highly nonlinear transition between short and long momentum. While this enables smooth interpolation, it may amplify noise near the inflection point and cause abrupt shifts when Z-score crosses thresholds. A linear scaling of the Z-score (e.g., clipped between 0 and 1) could provide sufficient adaptivity with better stability. Removing the sigmoid and logarithmic transformations reduces symbolic complexity and free parameters, aligning with the principle of simplicity. This change maintains the core idea—volatility-driven lookback adaptation—but with improved robustness. Additionally, the current factor uses multiple base features ($high, $low, $close) and several derived functions (Z-score, sigmoid, log return), which increases ER and SL. Simplifying the expression will reduce overfitting risk and improve generalization."

All three implemented factors are functionally identical in formulation: they compute the 20-day correlation between log(close) and log(volume), apply a 20-day time-series z-score, and then apply tanh. Despite minor naming and description differences, the mathematical expression is the same across all: F = tanh(TS_ZSCORE(TS_CORR(log(close), log(volume), 20), 20)). Therefore, these represent a single factor tested under different naming conventions or documentation, not distinct variations. The results show consistent improvement over the SOTA across all metrics: higher annualized return (0.116 vs 0.098), higher information ratio (1.826 vs 1.490), lower max drawdown (-0.0795 vs -0.0896), and higher IC (0.005675 vs 0.005111). This indicates stronger predictive power, better risk-adjusted performance, and improved drawdown control. Notably, the factor avoids cross-sectional operations, adaptive scaling, and regime-dependent parameters, aligning with the hypothesis that simplicity enhances robustness. No complexity warnings were raised, and the symbol length, base features (2: $close, $volume), and free parameters (only window=20, one constant) are minimal, suggesting low risk of overfitting. The tanh transformation successfully bounds extreme signals without sacrificing performance, validating its use as a stable nonlinearity.",

The simplified design—using fixed 20-day windows, time-series z-score, and static tanh—outperforms the SOTA across all key metrics, particularly in risk-adjusted return (information ratio) and drawdown control. The absence of adaptive gain or volatility scaling does not degrade performance; instead, it likely contributes to stability. The success of this approach underscores the value of reducing unnecessary complexity in signal processing. The consistent improvement suggests that removing regime-dependent or cross-sectional dependencies enhances generalization.

While the factor design aims to improve risk-adjusted performance (information ratio > 1.0) and maintain high predictive power (IC ≥ 0.009), the actual results fall short on both fronts. The information ratio (0.612) is significantly below the target and SOTA (0.996), and the IC (0.0067) is below the required threshold of 0.009 and also trails the SOTA (0.0091). The annualized return (0.056) is lower than SOTA (0.086), and the max drawdown (-0.138) is worse than SOTA (-0.110), indicating both lower returns and higher risk. Although the hypothesis avoids nonlinear transformations to reduce overreaction, the current formulation appears to underfit or mis-synchronize the adaptive weighting mechanism. Both implemented factors use similar logic—clipped Z-scores of KLEN to blend 5-day and 20-day returns—but differ slightly in normalization (absolute price range vs. relative range). Despite this, neither achieves the desired performance lift.",

The simplification of using linear scaling and clipping without sigmoid or log transformations has led to a degradation in performance across all key metrics. The factor fails to achieve the target IC and information ratio, and underperforms SOTA in both return and risk dimensions. This suggests that the removal of nonlinear smoothing may have eliminated necessary dampening of noise during volatile periods, or that the current Z-score window (10 days) and clipping range (0 to 1) are suboptimal. The adaptive interpolation mechanism may not be capturing regime shifts effectively with the current parameterization.",

Using MAD instead of EWStd increases robustness to extreme intraday ranges. Expanding the clipping bounds allows more dynamic weight variation, enabling stronger shifts toward short-term momentum during high volatility. Centering the KLEN signal around its median improves symmetry in regime detection. This maintains the hypothesis's core principle of avoiding sigmoid/log functions while enhancing robustness and responsiveness through more stable normalization and flexible clipping.

        "observations": "The combined results show that the current implementation of the simplified dynamic momentum factor does not support the target hypothesis. While the factor design aims to improve risk-adjusted performance (information ratio > 1.0) and maintain high predictive power (IC ≥ 0.009), the actual results fall short on both fronts. The information ratio (0.612) is significantly below the target and SOTA (0.996), and the IC (0.0067) is below the required threshold of 0.009 and also trails the SOTA (0.0091). The annualized return (0.056) is lower than SOTA (0.086), and the max drawdown (-0.138) is worse than SOTA (-0.110), indicating both lower returns and higher risk. Although the hypothesis avoids nonlinear transformations to reduce overreaction, the current formulation appears to underfit or mis-synchronize the adaptive weighting mechanism. Both implemented factors use similar logic—clipped Z-scores of KLEN to blend 5-day and 20-day returns—but differ slightly in normalization (absolute price range vs. relative range). Despite this, neither achieves the desired performance lift.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The current results refute the hypothesis. The simplification of using linear scaling and clipping without sigmoid or log transformations has led to a degradation in performance across all key metrics. The factor fails to achieve the target IC and information ratio, and underperforms SOTA in both return and risk dimensions. This suggests that the removal of nonlinear smoothing may have eliminated necessary dampening of noise during volatile periods, or that the current Z-score window (10 days) and clipping range (0 to 1) are suboptimal. The adaptive interpolation mechanism may not be capturing regime shifts effectively with the current parameterization.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current failure likely stems from over-clipping and sensitivity to outliers in the exponentially weighted standard deviation. Using MAD instead of EWStd increases robustness to extreme intraday ranges. Expanding the clipping bounds allows more dynamic weight variation, enabling stronger shifts toward short-term momentum during high volatility. Centering the KLEN signal around its median improves symmetry in regime detection. This maintains the hypothesis's core principle of avoiding sigmoid/log functions while enhancing robustness and responsiveness through more stable normalization and flexible clipping. The piecewise linear design preserves interpretability and avoids complexity inflation."

        "observations": "The combined results show mixed performance relative to the SOTA. While the current hypothesis aims to improve predictive consistency (IC) and risk-adjusted returns (IR) through a robust, normalized, and multiplicatively combined interaction factor, the empirical results indicate deterioration across key metrics: IC (0.004583 vs. 0.005798), information ratio (0.792 vs. 0.973), and max drawdown (-0.0918 vs. -0.0726). The annualized return is also slightly lower (0.0511 vs. 0.0520). All three implemented factors are structurally complex, with multiple nested time-series transformations and multiplicative interactions. Although no explicit complexity warnings were provided, the formulations suggest high symbol length (SL > 300 likely), multiple base features (ER = 2: $close, $volume), and several free parameters (e.g., 1e-6, rank normalization denominators), increasing the risk of overfitting. The use of rank-based and Z-score-based normalizations improves robustness in theory but may reduce signal strength in practice if over-normalized.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The current implementation does not support the hypothesis. Despite the theoretically sound motivation—enhancing signal robustness via multiplicative interaction and inverse volume volatility weighting—the execution leads to weaker performance across all metrics. The degradation in IC and IR suggests that the factor combination introduces noise or overfitting rather than suppressing it. The worsening max drawdown indicates poorer tail risk control, contradicting the claim of improved robustness during volatile regimes. The use of multiple normalization layers (Z-score, rank, reciprocal, exponential damping) may be over-engineering the signal, leading to diminished predictive power.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The failure of the current hypothesis stems from excessive normalization and structural complexity. Each component (ROC, CORR, VSTD) is individually transformed using rank, Z-score, exponential, and reciprocal functions, which may strip away meaningful variation. Simpler weighting—such as direct inverse volatility scaling—has proven effective in risk parity and factor investing literature. By reducing the number of transformations and applying normalization only at the final stage, we preserve the dynamic range of the original signals while still controlling for volatility regime effects. This approach reduces symbol length, limits free parameters, and uses fewer base features, aligning with the principle of simplicity and robustness. Prior research (e.g., volatility weighting in Fama-French models) supports that simple inverse volatility scaling improves Sharpe ratios without overfitting."

        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is strongly supported: a minimal interaction factor combining long-term reversal and short-term price-volume convergence, weighted by inverse volume volatility and followed by a single Z-score normalization, improves both predictive consistency (IC) and risk-adjusted returns (IR). The results confirm that noise suppression via volume volatility weighting enhances signal strength, particularly in volatile regimes. The consistent formulation across three variants suggests the core logic is robust. However, the slight increase in max drawdown indicates potential instability during extreme market moves, possibly due to the multiplicative interaction amplifying signals when volume volatility is low. The absence of logarithmic transformations or nested normalizations appears beneficial, aligning with the minimal design principle.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "While the current factor improves IR and IC, the increase in max drawdown suggests it may overreact during low-volume volatility periods. Replacing the fixed 5-day window with an adaptive weighting scheme—such as an exponential moving standard deviation with regime-based half-life—could maintain signal strength during stable periods while reducing sensitivity during transitions. This preserves the minimal interaction principle but introduces dynamic responsiveness. Additionally, exploring a capped version of the inverse weight (e.g., clipping 1 / (TS_STD + ε) at extreme values) could prevent outlier amplification. These modifications stay within the theoretical framework of noise-suppressed signal enhancement but refine the weighting mechanism for better tail risk control."

        "observations": "The implemented factors under the hypothesis show mixed performance compared to the current SOTA. While the hypothesis aims to improve risk-adjusted returns and reduce drawdowns through adaptive volatility weighting, the results indicate deterioration across all key metrics: lower annualized return, lower information ratio, higher (worse) max drawdown, and lower IC. The failure to improve upon SOTA suggests that the current implementation of adaptive volume volatility weighting may not be effectively capturing regime shifts or may be introducing noise. Notably, the Dynamic_Smoothing_Reversal_Convergence_Factor_60D and Regime_Adjusted_Inverse_Volume_Volatility_Weight_5D were implemented but did not deliver the expected benefits, indicating potential issues in the regime detection logic or the weighting mechanism.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The current results refute the target hypothesis. The adaptive regime-adjusted halflife mechanism, as implemented, does not enhance performance and instead degrades all measured metrics. This suggests that either the regime-switching logic (based on 5-day MA of volume) is not accurately identifying meaningful liquidity regimes, or that the halflife adjustment (5 vs 10) is too coarse. Additionally, the absence of the fully refined factor (Adaptive_Halflife_Volume_Volatility_Weighted_Reversal_60D) means the core theoretical improvement was not tested. The complexity of the implemented factors should be reviewed—particularly the number of conditional branches and moving windows—to ensure they are not overfitting to historical regime patterns.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The failure of the binary regime-switching model suggests that abrupt changes in halflife (5 vs 10) may disrupt signal continuity. A continuous adjustment—where halflife varies smoothly with the strength of the volume trend—could provide more stable and responsive weighting. Removing the discrete condition reduces complexity and potential overfitting. The 60-day reversal and 20-day correlation remain strong base signals; improving their weighting mechanism without adding discrete logic may yield better generalization. This approach maintains the core insight of adaptive sensitivity while reducing structural complexity."

The formulations involve multiple free parameters (e.g., halflife choices, window sizes of 10, 20, 60 days), high symbol length expressions, and multiple base features (volume, float, price), increasing the risk of over-engineering.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors use multiple layers of transformations (log, delta, EMA, CORR, STD, ROC, ZSCORE) and combine several signals multiplicatively, which increases symbol length and free parameters. For example, Turnover_Adaptive_Volatility_Weighted_Reversal_60D uses halflife-based TS_STD in the denominator, which is not well-defined in the formulation and likely introduces instability. Smooth_Turnover_Volatility_Regime_Score_10D uses second-order differences on log turnover—a high-sensitivity operator prone to noise. These complexities likely degrade out-of-sample performance despite decent IC. A simpler formulation—such as ZSCORE(ROC_60 * (volume/float)) or ZSCORE(TS_CORR(return, pctChange(volume/float), 20)) with fixed windows and no adaptive scaling—would reduce overfitting risk while preserving the core insight. Simpler factors are more likely to generalize, especially in cross-sectional ranking contexts where monotonicity and robustness matter more than nuanced dynamics."

        "observations": "The current experiment implemented two out of the three proposed factors (VWCV5 and VWIR5), while VATS10 was not implemented. The resulting portfolio shows a modest annualized return of 0.0457 and an information ratio of 0.7307, which are reasonable but not outstanding. The IC is very low at 0.0043, indicating poor predictive power of the factor signals for next-day returns. The max drawdown is acceptable at -0.0956. However, the absence of VATS10—a key component of the hypothesized triplet—severely limits the ability to validate the full hypothesis. Moreover, the two implemented factors do not appear to form a sufficiently strong or complementary signal to drive robust out-of-sample performance.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The current results neither strongly support nor definitively refute the target hypothesis, as the hypothesis relies on a *triplet* of factors (VWCV, VWIR, VATS), but only two were implemented and tested. The low IC suggests that the current factor pair lacks predictive power, possibly due to missing the directional momentum signal provided by VATS. The hypothesis emphasizes *simplified* and *robust* institutional signal extraction, but the current implementation does not achieve sufficient signal strength. Additionally, while symbolic complexity was not explicitly flagged, the formulations of VWCV5 and VWIR5 are already moderate in complexity; adding VATS10 in its current form may further increase complexity and risk overfitting if not carefully regularized.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "Since the full triplet was not tested, we cannot validate the original hypothesis. However, the current results suggest that the volatility and range components alone are insufficient for strong prediction. The next logical step is to complete the triplet with a *simplified* version of the trend signal. The current VATS10 formulation is moderately complex (involving SIGN, return, volume, and normalization), which increases the risk of overfitting, especially when combined with other factors. A simpler trend proxy—such as signed volume imbalance or a binary trend flag—could preserve directional information while reducing symbolic load. Additionally, aligning all windows (e.g., 5-day for all) may improve coherence and reduce parameter sprawl. The goal is to test whether a *minimalist* version of the institutional signal triplet can outperform more complex variants by focusing on robustness and generalization."

        "hypothesis": "Hypothesis: A minimalist triplet combining 5-day volume-adjusted close-to-close volatility (VWCV5), 5-day volume-weighted intraday range (VWIR5), and a simplified 10-day signed volume imbalance (SVI10) as a trend proxy achieves higher out-of-sample IC and information ratio by reducing symbolic complexity, aligning lookback windows, and preserving core institutional trading signals without overfitting.\n                Concise Observation: The prior attempts to build a volume-aware triplet failed to achieve strong predictive power due to either incomplete implementation (missing trend component) or excessive symbolic complexity in factor construction, leading to low IC despite moderate IR; the current evidence suggests that simpler, more robust proxies for institutional activity—particularly in the trend dimension—are needed to improve generalization.\n                Concise Justification: Reducing non-linear operations, avoiding ratios of rolling statistics, and using monotonic transformations like signed volume sums enhance stability and reduce overfitting risk, while still capturing the economic intuition that institutional traders influence volatility, range, and directional persistence in price movements.\n                Concise Knowledge: If volume-adjusted volatility is measured via rolling standard deviation of volume-weighted log returns, then it captures price variation confirmed by trading activity without numerical instability; when intraday range is scaled by volume-to-turnover ratio over a 5-day window, then it highlights informed trading during high-dispersion periods; and when trend strength is proxied by the sum of signed daily volume over 10 days (SVI10), then it reflects persistent institutional order flow with minimal transformation.\n                concise Specification: Define three factors: VWCV5 (5-day rolling std of volume-weighted log returns, return = log($close/$prev_close) * $volume), VWIR5 (5-day rolling mean of ($high - $low) * $volume / $turnover), and SVI10 (10-day sum of SIGN($close - $prev_close) * $volume), each computed with fixed windows, no division by rolling means, and saved in separate result.h5 files for modular testing in Qlib.\n                ",

While these results are non-trivial, they are relatively modest compared to typical SOTA performance in institutional quant strategies, where information ratios above 1.2 and ICs above 0.01 are often targeted. The max drawdown of -0.121 is acceptable but not exceptional. All three factors were successfully implemented and align with the minimalist hypothesis—using short lookbacks (5–10 days), avoiding deeply nested expressions, and relying on core institutional signals (volume-price interaction, trend-implied order flow). Crucially, none of the individual factor formulations appear overly complex: each uses 2–3 raw features, minimal free parameters, and straightforward operations (log returns, sign functions, rolling means/stds). The total symbol length across the triplet is estimated under 250 characters, and each factor uses only 2–3 base features, well below the overfitting threshold. This suggests the model is not overfitting due to symbolic complexity, which supports the core hypothesis.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis that a minimalist triplet combining volume-adjusted volatility, intraday range, and signed volume imbalance can achieve strong out-of-sample performance is partially supported. The design principles—aligned lookbacks, reduced symbolic complexity, and focus on institutional signals—are sound and reflected in stable, positive metrics. However, the magnitude of improvement over typical baseline models is not yet demonstrated, and no direct comparison to a prior SOTA is provided in the query. If this triplet is intended to replace a more complex predecessor, the current results suggest it trades off some performance for robustness. The absence of complexity warnings and the clean mathematical forms are strengths. To fully validate the hypothesis, a direct comparison with a more complex, over-parameterized version of the same signals is needed to prove that simplicity does not sacrifice alpha.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "Among the three factors, SVI10 captures directional institutional pressure most directly, while VWIR5 indicates periods of high price discovery. By adaptively scaling the signed volume imbalance by the normalized intraday range (e.g., using VWIR5 as a volatility regime filter), the signal can become more responsive during high-dispersion days without introducing non-linear overfitting. This maintains the minimalist framework but introduces a dynamic weighting that better aligns with market microstructure theory. The core features remain unchanged, preserving interpretability and low complexity. This approach refines the hypothesis rather than abandoning it, exploring a more intelligent aggregation method instead of simple linear combination."

Notably, the hypothesis anticipated that adaptive scaling of SVI10 using VWIR5 would enhance trend sensitivity in high-information regimes, but the results suggest limited effectiveness. All three factors operate within a similar conceptual framework of regime conditioning using VWIR5, yet none demonstrate strong predictive power. There is no indication of excessive symbolic complexity in the formulations provided, as all expressions appear concise and use only core features ($close, $high, $low, $volume) with standard time-series operators. However, the lack of performance improvement suggests the core mechanism—scaling or gating SVI10 by VWIR5-normalized signals—may not be capturing robust alpha in practice.",

This suggests that either the regime detection via VWIR5 is not effectively isolating informative periods, or the SVI10 signal itself lacks sufficient predictive power to begin with. Moreover, the three variations (adaptive scaling, z-score normalization, median-based binary switch) all follow similar logic but yield no clear winner, indicating potential saturation in this design space.",

        "reason": "The failure of the adaptive scaling approaches suggests that the added complexity of conditional weighting (whether continuous or binary) does not improve signal quality and may introduce estimation risk. Instead, standardizing SVI10 directly via rolling z-score (i.e., (SVI10 - mean(SVI10,20)) / std(SVI10,20)) would stabilize its distribution and improve comparability across instruments and time. Additionally, VWIR5 itself may carry trend information—periods of sustained high intraday dispersion could precede momentum continuation. Therefore, combining a normalized SVI10 with a positively trending VWIR5 (e.g., sign of 5-day VWIR5 momentum) as a separate additive term—rather than a multiplicative regime filter—might capture complementary dynamics more robustly. This approach reduces reliance on fragile interaction terms and focuses on stable, marginally predictive components.

        "observations": "The current combined result shows an information ratio of 0.52 and IC of 0.0048, which are significantly below the target thresholds of 1.0 and 0.008, respectively. The annualized return (0.035) is modest, and the max drawdown (-0.102) indicates moderate risk exposure. While three factors were successfully implemented—Adaptive_SVI10_VWIR_Scaled, Normalized_VWIR5_Regime_Factor, and Dynamic_Trend_Weighted_By_Volatility_Regime—none achieved the desired performance lift. Notably, the hypothesis anticipated that adaptive scaling of SVI10 using VWIR5 would enhance trend sensitivity in high-information regimes, but the results suggest limited effectiveness. All three factors operate within a similar conceptual framework of regime conditioning using VWIR5, yet none demonstrate strong predictive power. There is no indication of excessive symbolic complexity in the formulations provided, as all expressions appear concise and use only core features ($close, $high, $low, $volume) with standard time-series operators. However, the lack of performance improvement suggests the core mechanism—scaling or gating SVI10 by VWIR5-normalized signals—may not be capturing robust alpha in practice.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is refuted by the current results. Despite theoretically sound reasoning—amplifying trend signals during high-information-flow regimes—the implemented factors fail to achieve the target information ratio (>1.0) or IC (>0.008). The best-performing configuration only reaches IC = 0.0048 and IR = 0.52, which represents less than half the targeted skill level. This suggests that either the regime detection via VWIR5 is not effectively isolating informative periods, or the SVI10 signal itself lacks sufficient predictive power to begin with. Moreover, the three variations (adaptive scaling, z-score normalization, median-based binary switch) all follow similar logic but yield no clear winner, indicating potential saturation in this design space.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The failure of the adaptive scaling approaches suggests that the added complexity of conditional weighting (whether continuous or binary) does not improve signal quality and may introduce estimation risk. Instead, standardizing SVI10 directly via rolling z-score (i.e., (SVI10 - mean(SVI10,20)) / std(SVI10,20)) would stabilize its distribution and improve comparability across instruments and time. Additionally, VWIR5 itself may carry trend information—periods of sustained high intraday dispersion could precede momentum continuation. Therefore, combining a normalized SVI10 with a positively trending VWIR5 (e.g., sign of 5-day VWIR5 momentum) as a separate additive term—rather than a multiplicative regime filter—might capture complementary dynamics more robustly. This approach reduces reliance on fragile interaction terms and focuses on stable, marginally predictive components. The new formulation will be simpler (fewer operations, no nested conditions), more interpretable, and less prone to overfitting."

There is no explicit complexity warning, but the hypothesis introduces two distinct signals (standardized volume imbalance and binary volatility trend) with multiple lookback windows (10-day, 20-day, and 5-day), which increases model complexity and risk of overfitting despite the simple final combination.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis proposes that stabilizing SVI10 via z-score and combining it with a binary volatility trend flag improves predictability by capturing persistent regime effects. However, the marginal IC and moderate information ratio suggest that either the signal strength is weak or the interaction between the two components is not effectively capturing the intended regime dynamics. The lack of adaptive weighting or dynamic thresholding may limit the model’s ability to respond to structural market changes. Moreover, the binary trend flag may discard magnitude information, reducing its effectiveness.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current hypothesis combines two signals under the assumption that their interaction captures regime-aware behavior. However, the low IC suggests poor signal quality or overcomplication. Binary flags like T_VWIR5 discard continuous information and can introduce instability at decision boundaries. By focusing on a single, well-standardized factor (Z_SVI10_20D), we reduce complexity, avoid fragile interactions, and maintain smooth, rankable outputs—key for portfolio construction. Standardization alone may suffice to stabilize regime effects. Simpler factors are less prone to overfitting and often generalize better, especially when base signals like signed volume imbalance are inherently noisy. This shift aligns with the principle that fewer, higher-quality signals outperform complex composites in out-of-sample testing."

The current formulation already uses 1.4826 × TS_MAD to approximate standard deviation under normality, which assumes the underlying distribution is symmetric—this assumption is only valid if the series is properly centered. Thus, omitting median centering contradicts the statistical foundation of MAD-based scaling. By restoring median centering *only within TS_MAD*, we maintain minimal symbolic complexity (SL < 150), use only two base features (return, volume), and keep free parameters minimal (only the 1.4826 scale, which is theoretically justified).

The max drawdown is acceptable at -0.08596. Both implemented factors—VWSR10_MAD20_Minimal and VWSR10_MAD20_RankNorm—follow a minimal transformation philosophy, aligning with the core hypothesis of reducing symbolic complexity to improve out-of-sample performance. However, the IC is quite low, suggesting weak predictive power. The rank-normalized version introduces cross-sectional ranking, which may help with robustness but adds symbolic length and computational overhead. Despite the clean design, the performance gains over potential SOTA are marginal at best.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis emphasizes minimalism—avoiding median centering, log transforms, and excessive normalization—to reduce overfitting and improve generalization. This is well-executed in VWSR10_MAD20_Minimal, which uses only volume-weighted returns and TS_MAD scaling. However, the low IC suggests that the signal may be too weak. The use of TS_MAD without median centering may preserve outliers rather than suppress them, counterproductively increasing noise. The rank-normalized variant improves comparability across instruments but increases symbolic complexity, potentially undermining the core hypothesis. Neither factor shows a decisive improvement in predictive power, indicating that the current formulation may be *too minimal* to capture meaningful signal.",

        "reason": "The current hypothesis avoids all centering, but this may allow strong biases in the raw signal to persist. Median centering within TS_MAD (i.e., MAD = median(|x - median(x)|)) is a robust, non-linear normalization that suppresses outliers without introducing parametric assumptions. Reintroducing median centering *within* the TS_MAD computation (which is standard in its definition) aligns with robust statistics while maintaining simplicity. The current formulation already uses 1.4826 × TS_MAD to approximate standard deviation under normality, which assumes the underlying distribution is symmetric—this assumption is only valid if the series is properly centered. Thus, omitting median centering contradicts the statistical foundation of MAD-based scaling. By restoring median centering *only within TS_MAD*, we maintain minimal symbolic complexity (SL < 150), use only two base features (return, volume), and keep free parameters minimal (only the 1.4826 scale, which is theoretically justified). This修正 strengthens the signal without increasing overfitting risk."

While the robust centering in the second factor theoretically improves statistical correctness, the empirical improvement over the first is not evident from the provided combined results (which appear aggregated). The IC is particularly low, suggesting weak predictive power despite sound theoretical grounding. No explicit complexity metrics (e.g., symbol length, parameter count) are provided, but the formulations are mathematically concise and use only core features ($close, $volume) with well-defined time-series operations.

This maintains economic interpretability and uses only one additional logical condition (e.g., TS_QUANTILE), keeping complexity low.

        "observations": "Both factors VWSR10_MAD20_CENTERED and VWSR10_MAD20_ROBUST_CENTERED were successfully implemented and tested. The current results show moderate performance: an annualized return of 0.066, information ratio of 0.874, and a relatively low IC of 0.0055. The max drawdown is acceptable at -0.100. While the robust centering in the second factor theoretically improves statistical correctness, the empirical improvement over the first is not evident from the provided combined results (which appear aggregated). The IC is particularly low, suggesting weak predictive power despite sound theoretical grounding. No explicit complexity metrics (e.g., symbol length, parameter count) are provided, but the formulations are mathematically concise and use only core features ($close, $volume) with well-defined time-series operations. There is no indication of over-engineering in terms of base features (ER = 2) or excessive symbolic length (estimated < 150 characters), so overfitting due to complexity is unlikely.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis is partially supported: the use of robust statistics via MAD with proper median centering is correctly implemented and maintains interpretability. However, the out-of-sample performance (particularly IC and annualized return) does not demonstrate a clear advantage over potential SOTA benchmarks. The low IC suggests that while the normalization is statistically sound, it may be over-smoothing the signal or removing economically meaningful variation. The factor captures volume-weighted return momentum over 10 days but may lack sensitivity to regime changes or higher-frequency dynamics. The robustness principle is valid, but its current implementation may be too conservative.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factor applies uniform robust scaling regardless of market conditions, which may weaken predictive power during low-volatility periods when signals are more reliable. By introducing a simple regime-switching mechanism—such as scaling the factor differently when MAD is in its top vs. bottom quartile—we can adaptively preserve signal strength without compromising robustness. This maintains economic interpretability and uses only one additional logical condition (e.g., TS_QUANTILE), keeping complexity low. The modification targets improving IC by enhancing signal-to-noise ratio adaptively, rather than globally suppressing variation. This direction explores a nuanced extension of the same robust statistics framework, rather than abandoning it."
