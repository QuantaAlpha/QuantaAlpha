The proposed factors—Microstructure_Fundamental_Convergence_8D, Volatility_Transition_Convergence_10D, and MultiTimeframe_Reversal_Signal_15D—are conceptually aligned with the hypothesis, aiming to capture convergence of microstructure inefficiency, fundamental deterioration, and volatility transitions. However, their formulations exhibit significant issues: 1) They misuse RANK without clear cross-sectional ranking logic in a time-series calculation. 2) They lack explicit proxies for bid-ask volume ratios, profitability decline, or market overreaction (e.g., using close-open as a proxy for order flow is weak). 3) The volatility transition factor uses DELTA(TS_STD(close,10),5) which is ambiguous (likely intended as TS_STD(close,10) - TS_STD(close,10).shift(5)). 4) The MultiTimeframe factor uses correlation between normalized volume and 15-day mean close, which may not capture fundamental deterioration.

The original factors were overly complex, mixing cross-sectional ranking (RANK) with time-series operations, which is computationally problematic and often leads to implementation errors. The new hypothesis focuses on core, interpretable components: volume anomaly (e.g., volume / TS_MEAN(volume, window)), price momentum (e.g., returns over a window), and volatility change (e.g., TS_STD(returns, window)). By avoiding nested functions and ambiguous operations like DELTA and RANK in time-series, factors become easier to implement, less prone to overfitting, and more likely to generate valid outputs. This aligns with the critical complexity control requirement—targeting symbol length <150 characters and using 2-4 core features. For example, a factor like (volume / TS_MEAN(volume, 10)) * (close / TS_MEAN(close, 10) - 1) * (TS_STD(returns, 10) / TS_STD(returns, 20)) captures volume spike, price deviation, and volatility increase simply."
